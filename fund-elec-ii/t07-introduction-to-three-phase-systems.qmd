## Some General Knowledge

| Process | Voltage | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| Generation | 11-15  kV | 3 phase |
| Transmission | 100-400 kV | 3 phase |
| Distribution | 11 kV | 3 phase |
| Consumption | 415 V or 240 V | 3 phase or single phase |

Cycle of electricity transfer from power plan to a house:

- Power Plant
- Step-up transformer
- High-voltage Transmission line
- Step-down transformer (substation)

| Wire Colour | Notation |
|---|---|
| R red | L1 |
| Y yellow | L2 |
| B blue | L3 |
| N | |

## Three-Phase Generator:
- Has 3 coils each seperated by an angle of $120^\circ $
- Hence has 3 sine waves
- Made of magnet (mobile) and conductor (stationary)
- The 3 line wires are of colors: Red, Yellow, Blue

Voltage differences between wires:
- $415~V$ between line and line
- $240~V$ between line and neutral

\begin{align*}
    e_{AN} &= E_{m(AN)} \sin \omega t \\
    e_{BN} &= E_{m(VN)} \sin (\omega t - 120^\circ) \\
    e_{CN} &= E_{m(CN)} \sin (\omega t + 120^\circ) \\
\end{align*}

- $AN$ stands for: from A (line) to the neutral
- Line voltage $(V_{ph} \text{ or } V_\phi)$: $\Delta V$ b/w line-line
- Phase voltage $(V_L)$: $\Delta V$ b/w line-neutral

Phase sequence change can change the direction of turns of a motor

Motor:

| Delta connection | Y (Wye) connection |
|---|---|
| No common point | Has common point |

## Y-Connected Generator

$E_L = V_\phi \sqrt{3}$

$I_L = I_\phi$

- Sum of line voltages is $0~\text{V}$.
- Phase rotation, or phase sequence, is the order in which the voltage waveforms of a polyphase AC source reach their respective peaks.
- The phase sequence can be determined by the order in which the phasors pass through a fixed point on the phasor diagram if the phasors are rotated in a counterclockwise direction.
- The phase sequence for the line voltages is the same as for phase voltages.
- The phase sequence is quite important in the three-phase distribution of power.
- In a three-phase motor, for example, if two phase voltages are interchanged, the sequence will change, and the direction of rotation of the motor will be reversed.
- If the load is balanced, the neutral connection can be removed without affecting the circuit in any manner; that is, if  $Z_1 = Z_2 = Z_3$    then $I_N$ will be zero.

## Y-Connected Generator with a Y-Connected Load

$E_L = V_\phi \sqrt{3}$

$I_L = I_\phi$

## Y-$\Delta$ System

$V_L = V_\phi$

$I_L = I_\phi \cdot \sqrt{3}$

- Here the magnitudes of the line and phase currents will be equal

\begin{align*}
    P_\phi &= V_\phi I_\phi \cos \theta \\
    P_T &= 3 P_\phi \\
    P_T &= \sqrt 3 V_\phi I_\phi \cos \theta \\
    Q_\phi &= V_\phi I_\phi \sin \theta \\
\end{align*}

## Three-Wattmeter Method

$P_{T_Y} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3$
