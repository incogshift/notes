## Circuits
In a series circuit, in place of $R$, we use $Z$:
 -  $Z_T = Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3 \dots$

### Resistors

For a circuit with a resistor and ac source:
- $i = I \sin \omega t = I \angle 0^\circ, \text{ where } I = I_m$
- $Z = R \angle 0^\circ$

### Inductors

For a circuit with an inductor and an AC source:
- $i = I_m \sin (\omega t -90^\circ) = I\angle -90^\circ$, when $v = V \angle 0^\circ$
- $v = V\angle 90^\circ$, when $i = I \angle 0^\circ$
- $Z = X_L \angle 90^\circ$

### Capacitors

For a circuit with a capacitor and an AC source:

- $i = I_m \sin (\omega t + 90^\circ) = I\angle 90^\circ$, when $v = V \angle 0^\circ$
- $v = V\angle -90^\circ$, when $i = I \angle 0^\circ$
- $Z = X_C \angle -90^\circ$

## RLC circuit

In an $RLC$ circuit, depending on the value of the resistance and reactances, the circuit is resistive, inductive or capacitive.

### Impedence Diagram

> **&#9432; Note** <br>
> $Z_C \neq X_C\angle90^\circ$ <br>
> $Z_C = X_C\angle-90^\circ$

For any configuration, the angle associated with the total impedance is the angle by which the applied voltage leads the source current.

| Network | $\theta_{Z_T}$ |
|---|---|
| Inductive  | $+ve$ |
| Capacitive | $-ve$  |

### Series ac Circuits (Configurations)

Impedances behave like resistors in series.
$$Z_T = \sum Z_n$$

Calculating in complex mode (recommended to use):

> **&#9432; Note** <br>
> In all places, angles are required in equations except in avg power formula ($P=VI\cos\theta$). <br>
> Each attribute has its own angle except avg power

- Polar notation
$$
\begin{align*}
    E &= I \cdot Z_T \\
    I &= \frac{E}{Z_T} \\
    V_{Z_x} &= I_T \cdot Z_x \\
    I_{Z_x} &= I \\
\end{align*}
$$

- Rectangular notation

$$
\begin{align*}
    Z &= R+j(X_L-X_C) \\
\end{align*}
$$

Calculating in non-complex mode (not recommended to use):

$$
\begin{align*}
    Z &= \sqrt{R^2+X} \\
    X &= X_L-X_C\\
    \theta &= \tan^{-1} \frac{X}{R} \\
\end{align*}
$$

Calculations that are complex independant:

$P=EI\cos\theta$

#### Voltage Divider Rule

$V_x = \dfrac{E}{Z_T}Z_x$

<details>

> **&#9432; Note** <br>
> Basically, this is Ohm's law. The only change is that $I$ has been expanded

$V_x = I \cdot Z_x = \dfrac{E}{Z_T}Z_x$

</details>

#### Kirchoff's Voltage Law

The sum of the input voltages and voltage drops in a closed loop is zero 

### Resonance

Condition for resonance:

$$X_L = X_C$$

Frequency:

$$f = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}$$

Derivation for $f$


> **&#9432; Note** <br>
> This is very simple, use when you forget the formula for $f$, all you need to remember is the condition for resonace.

$$
\begin{align*}
    X_L &= X_C \\
    \omega L &= \frac{1}{\omega C} \\
    2\pi fL &= \frac{1}{2\pi fC} \\
    f^2 &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2LC} \\
    f& = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}} \\
\end{align*}
$$

### Applying the general approach to a series RLC circuit

- Apply the phasor notation

![image](images/image-2.png)

- Calculate the total impedance of the circuit
    - $Z_T = Z_R + Z_L + Z_C$
- Draw: Impedance diagram

- Determine the total current
    - $I = \dfrac{E}{Z_T}$
- Find the voltage across each element
    - $V_R = IZ_R = (I\angle\theta)(R\angle 0^\circ)$
    - $V_L = IZ_L = (I\angle\theta)(X_L\angle 90^\circ)$
    - $V_C = IZ_C = (I\angle\theta)(X_C\angle -90^\circ)$
- Apply Kirchoff's voltage law
 $\sum V = E-V_R-V_L-V_C = 0 \text{ or } E = V_R+V_L+V_C$, verified through phasor diagram
- Draw the phasor diagram
- Determine the power to the circuit
    - $P=V_mI_m\cos\theta$
- Calculate the power factor
    - $F_p = \cos \theta_T = \dfrac{R}{Z_T}$

## Frequency Response for Series ac Circuits

In a series R-L-C circuit:
- At very low frequencies, the total impedance will be determined primarily by the capacitor (C).
- At very high frequencies, the total impedance will be determined primarily by the inductor (L).
