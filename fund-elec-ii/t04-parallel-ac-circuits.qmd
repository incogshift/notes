**Vector**: A quantity that has direction

## Admittance ($Y$) and Susceptance ($B$)

In parallel:
- Susceptances are added together.
- Impedances are treated in the same manner as resistors

$$
\begin{align*}
    Y &= \frac{1}{Z} \\
    B &= \frac{1}{X} \\
\end{align*}
$$

| Admittance, $Y$ | Susceptance, $B$ |
|---|---|
|$Y$ is a vector | $B$ is a magnitude.|
| Has an angle like $Z$ does | Has no angle like $R$ or $X$ does not |
| Defined from impedance or used for all elements | Defined from reactance or used only for reactive elements |

| Susceptance, $B$ | Conductance, $G$ |
|---|---|
| Reciprocal of reactance | Reciprocal of resistance |
| Only for reactive elements | Only for resistive elements |

| Reactive elements | Resistive elements |
|---|---|
| $Y= B \angle\theta$ | $Y=G\angle\theta$

## Parallel AC Circuits

### General approach to solving a parallel circuit

1. Apply the phasor notation to the network.

    I think this means change the time domain representations of voltage and current to phasor notation
2. Find:
    - $Z_T$ or $Y_T$, then $Z_T=\dfrac{1}{Y_T}$
3. Draw: Admittance diagram
4. Find:
    - $I_S$
    - $I_x$, use CDR:
        - for Multiple branches
            $$I_x = I_T\frac{Z_T}{Z_x}$$
        - or for 2 branches:
        $$I_\text{branch of interest} = I_T\frac{Z_\text{opposite branch}}{Z_\text{branch of interest}+Z_\text{opposite branch}}$$
5. Apply KCL at node of interest:
,.   
    Connecting source current branch and the branches where current splits
    
    $I_{\text{in}}\angle\theta_{I_{\text{in}}}=I_{\text{out}}\angle\theta_{I_{\text{out}}}$
    
    <details>
        Remember: this is in the same way as in DC circuits except the only difference is that current in AC is a vector.

6. Draw: Phasor diagram
7. Find:
    - $P~(P_\text{avg})$
    - $F_p$, Power factor.
