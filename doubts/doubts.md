1. Explain:
>Impedance, like resistance or reactance, is not a phasor quantity representing a time-varying function with a particular phase shift. It is simply an operating tool that is extremely useful in determining the magnitude and angle of quantities in a sinusoidal ac network.

2. Are output voltages the same as voltage drops?
