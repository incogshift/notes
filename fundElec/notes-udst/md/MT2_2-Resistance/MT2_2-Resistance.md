FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRICITY I

## INTRODUCTION

 The opposition to the flow of charge through an electrical circuit, called resistance, has the units of ohms and uses the Greek letter omega (Q) as its symbol.

 The graphic symbol for resistance. which resembles the cutting edge of asaw.

Resistance symbol and notation.

 This opposition, due primarily to collisions and friction between the free electrons and other electrons, ions, and atoms in the path of motion, converts the supplied electrical energy into heat that raises the temperature of the electrical component and surrounding medium.

 The heat you feel from an electrical heater is simply due to current passing through a hioh-resistance material

RESISTANCE: CIRCULAR WIRES

The resistance of any material is due primarily to four factors:

 Material · Length Cross-sectional area ·Temperature of the materiui

The first three elements are related by the following basic equation for resistance:

: Resistivity [ohm - cm or ohm - m] : Length [cm or m] : Area $[\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ or $m^2$ 1

Property of a material that indicates how much it will oppose current flow

The higher the resistivity, the greater the resistance of a conductor.

The longer the conductor, the greater the resistance.

The greater the area of a conductor, the less the resistance

EXAMPLE: Determine the resistance of 40 meter of copper wire if the diameter is 2.5mm ?

$\mathbf{p}=1.723\mathbf{x}10^{-6}$ L=40 m = 40 m = 4000 cm

# Resistance: Circular Wires

Example 1: Determine the resistance of a 10-m copper wire if the radius is 1 mm. [Copper resistivity is

Solution

Note: Q·cm = 10-2 Q·m

R= (1.72 · 10-8 Q-m · 10 m) /(TT ·(10-3m) 2 R = 0.0547 $\Omega=54.7$m$\Omega$

Exercise 1: Determine the resistance of a 30-m copper wire if the radius is 2 mm. [Copper resistivity is

# Example

We have 110.5 metres of aluminum wire having a diameter of 3.55mm. Find the resistance of the w ire. $\mathbf{\rho}=2.83$ x $10^-8$ ohm-m

Solution:

Area of the wire:

$$\begin{aligned}
&\mathrm{the~diameter~to~metres~3.55~mm=3.55~x~10^{-3}} \\
&\mathbf{A}=\frac{\pi\mathbf{d}^{2}}{4}\:\mathbf{d}\:\mathrm{is~the~diameter~and~\pi~is~a~constant} \\
&\mathbf{A}={\frac{\pi\left(3.55\mathbf{x}10^{-3}\mathbf{m}\right)^{2}}{4}}=9.898\:\mathbf{x}\:10^{-6}\:\mathbf{m}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

To find resistance R:

ohms
$$=\frac{\rho1}{\mathrm{A}}\:\mathrm{Ohms}=\frac{(2.83x10^{-8}olmn-m)(1105m)}{(9.898\mathrm{x}10^{-6}m^2)}=0.31$$

## TEMPERATURE EFFECTS

Temperature has a significant effect on the resistance of conductors, semiconductors, and insulators.

FIG.3.10Demonstrating the effect of a positive and a negative temperature coefficient on the resistance of a conductor.

## TEMPERATURE EFFECTS

### Conductors

an increase in temperature results in an in resistance the level. increase Consequently, conductors have a positive Semiconductorture coefficient.

an increase in temperature results in a decrease in level. the resistance semiconductors have Consequently, negative temperature coefficients. Insulators

an increase in temperature results in a decreasein the resistance of an insulator The result is a negative temperature coefficient.

# Temperature Coefficient of Resistance

· This factor with the symbol alpha (α) states how much the resistance changes for a change in temperature.

·A positive value for α means that R increases with temperature;. ·With a negative α, R decreases with temperature; · Zero for a means that R is constant.

Temperature coefficient of resistance for various. conductors at $20^\circ C$

$\alpha_{20}$ is called the temperature coeficient of a

 material

The higher the temperature coefficient of resistance for a material, the more sensitive the resistance level to changes in

# Temperature Coefficient of Resistance

· An increase in wire resistance caused by a rise in temperature can be calculated approximately from the formula:

![](./images/fRe2g0A95B5fvLnQP0INsAmerCpyLegBX.png)

Where $\mathrm{R}_0$ is the resistance at $20^\circ\mathbb{C}$

R, is the higher resistance at the higher temperature,

△t is the temperature rise above 20°C.

Important in Qatar because if high temperatures

# Temperature Coefficient of Resistance

Example 2: A copper wire has a $5-\Omega R$ at $20^{\circ}$C . Calculate its resistance at $30^{\circ}$C

Solution

$$\mathrm R=\mathrm R_{20}\left[1+\mathrm\alpha_{20}(\mathrm t-20^\circ\mathrm C)\right]$$

$$\mathrm R=5\:\Omega\left[1\:+\:0.00393(30^\circ\:\mathrm C\:-\:20^\circ\:\mathrm C)\right]$$

$$\mathrm R=5\:\Omega\:(1.0393)=5.1965\:\Omega $$

Exercise 2: A tungsten wire has a $18-\Omega R$ at $20^{\circ}$C . Calculate its resistance at $80^{\circ}$C

TYPES OF RESISTORS Fixed Resistors

· Resistors are made in many forms, but all belong in either of two groups: fixed or variable.

 The most common of the low-wattage, fixed type resistors is the film resistor. It is constructed by depositing a thin layer of resistive material (typically carbon, metal, or metal oxide) on a ceramic rod.

## CONDUCTANCE

By finding the reciprocal of the resistance of a material, we have a measure of how well the material conducts electricity. The quantity is called conductance, has the symbol G, and is measured in siemens (S) (note Fig. 3.31). In equation form, conductance is
