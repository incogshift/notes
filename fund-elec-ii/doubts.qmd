1. What does real power mean? How is it different from $Q,~P$ and $S$?
    
    **Ans:** <br>
    Real power stands for the power dissipated by the resistor.

2. Explain:
>Impedance, like resistance or reactance, is not a phasor quantity representing a time-varying function with a particular phase shift. It is simply an operating tool that is extremely useful in determining the magnitude and angle of quantities in a sinusoidal ac network.

3. Are output voltages the same as voltage drops?

## three phase systems

1. In a Delta system: when we have different line voltages, which one should be used for each branch of the delta system?

    **Ans:** <br>
    Have a look at the circuit connections. From which wire to which wire are the 2 points of a branch connected? Look for a line voltage that matches such a configuration.

2. Can resonance occur without resistance?

    **Ans:** <br>
    Theoretically, yes. But practically, no. Resonance circuits are fundamentally studied as RLC circuits

3. Which is correct: $j5~\Omega$ or $5j~\Omega$?

    **Ans:** <br>
    $j5~\Omega$

4. How to solve:
