driving

2. Collect all unfixed things inside the vehicle and put
them in a bag, box or in the trunk before driving

3. Ask passengers to keep quiet and not to divert your
jattention.

4. Stop tuning radio or switch on CDs player while
driving

5. Do not be occupied by looking outside the road, e.g
reading an advertising poster, traffic accident, etc. while
driving
