## 11.2-4 VSEPR Theory

VSEPR: Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion

 On paper, we have only 2 dimensions (x and y)

In real life, we have 3 dimensions

VSEPR theory can help us determine what our molecule wil look like inreal life

# VSEPR Theory

Properties of molecular substances depend on molecular structure

VSEPR theory is a simple model that allows us to account for molecular shape

Electron groups are defined as lone pairs, single bonds, double bonds, and triple bonds

VSEPR is based on the idea that electron groups repel one another through coulombic forces

# VSEPR Theory

Electrons want to be as far apart as possible - higher stability

The resulting geometric arrangement will allow us to predict the shapes and bond angles in the molecule

We focus on the CENTRAL ATOM only:

How many bonds is it forming?

How many lone pairs does it have?

Summary: Negative charges (electrons) repel other negative charges

![](./images/fsm2hHrh31kUxm4Ymd4UR0ceOnnDWvTA1.png)

# Electron Groups

 The Lewis structure predicts the number of valence electron pairs around the central atom(s)

Each lone pair of electrons constitutes one electron group or domain on a central atom

Each bond constitutes one electron group on a central atom, regardless of whether it is single, double, or triple.

There are three electron groups (domains) on N:

![](./images/fYBwpb1ViKWmfkfKsN5aFqwwwwwRRCAIm.png)

· One lone pair

· One single bond

· One double bond

# Electron Group Geometry

There are five basic arrangements of electron groups around a central atom

oBased on a maximum of six bonding electron groups

Various electron groups are possible

Two, three,.....six electron groups

Geometry can be determined based on this

o

Two - linear Three - triangular Four - tetrahedron Five - trigonal bipyramid Six - octahedron

o

When there are 2 electron groups around the central atom, they occupy positions on opposite sides of the central atom

This results in the electron groups taking a linear geometry

The bond angle is 180°

![](./images/fFwde5f9BGZt0EM6gDgGGhTCNLIdQ54gA.png)

![](./images/fAb6lDgPEZBZOZLkoaGfNPG2FrYOKUmTL.png)

![](./images/fHuGGc1iWEiShW3bgD8dhGoHgCkZCLdvo.png)

When there are three electron groups around the central atom, they wil occupy positions in the shape of a triangle around the central atom This results in the electron groups taking a trigonal planar geometry The bond angle is 120°

![](./images/fp4l0kbxqVee1rnK8thIIblNKgLdchreu.png)

## Trigonal Planar Geometry

Formaldehyde has three electron groups around the central atom, so we predict trigonal planar geometry, 120 bond angles

However, different types of electron groups exert slightly different repulsions-the resulting bond angles reflect these minor differences

![](./images/fgn9HGuVa0ZrFpcx8Gd6uTwSGRNhOMs8o.png)

![](./images/fmG5DCGFEygbaaNhe4g5740ua3UpmxbwT.png)

A central atom in a three-atom molecule forms two double bonds (and has no lone pairs). What is the geometry of the molecule?

a. Trigonal planar b. Linear

c. Not enough information is given to determine the geometry of the molecule. To solve the problem, it is necessary to know how many electron pairs are on the other two atoms.

# Four Electron Groups: Tetrahedral Electron Geometry

When there are four electron groups around the central atom, they will occupy positions in the shape of a tetrahedron around the central atom This results in the electron groups taking a tetrahedral geometry · The bond angles are 109.5°

![](./images/fuwp6cPgnXzQPyxkhRo2YxsOSHUIo57e2.png)

# Concept Check

What is the geometry of the HCN molecule? The Lewis structure of HCN is

$$\text{H-C=N:}$$

a. linear.

b. trigonal planar c. tetrahedral

When there are five electron groups around the central atom, the electron groups take a trigonal bipyramidal geometry

Three of the groups lie in a single plane, as in the trigonal planar configuration; the other two are positioned above and below this plane

The angles in the trigonal bipyramidal structure are not all the same The bond angle between equatorial positions is 120° The bond angle between axial and equatorial positions is

Ci

:C1:

90°

# Six Electron Groups: Octahedral Electron Geometry

· When there are six electron groups around the central atom, they will occupy positions in the shape of two square-base pyramids

 This results in the electron groups taking an octahedral geometry

- It is called octahedral because the geometric figure has eight sides · All positions are equivalent · The bond angle is 90°

Octahedral geometry

# Electron-Domain Geometry

![](./images/f4u8FBUw22Si87YLWcizd4mwGddaTHcII.png)

Electron group geometry and molecular geometry differ when lone pairs of electrons are present.

## The Effect of Lone Pairs

· The actual geometry of the molecule may be different from the electron geometry

Lone pair electrons typically exert slightly greater repulsion than bonding electrons, affecting the bond angles

· A lone electron pair is more spread out in space than a bonding electron pair because a lone pair is attracted to only one nucleus while a bonding pair is attracted to two nuclei

· In general, electron group repulsions vary as follows:

- lone pair-lone pair > lone pair-bonding pair > bonding pair-bonding pair

Count only electron groups around the central atom. Each of the following is considered one electron group: a lone pair, a single bond, a double bond, a triple bond, or a single electron.

## How to draw the molecular geometry

1. Draw the Lewis structure.
2. Determine the number of electron groups around the central atom.
3. Classify each electron group as a bonding or lone pair, and then count each type
4. Remember, multiple bonds count as one group.
5. Use the tables to determine the shape and bond angles.

Draw the VSEPR shape for:

* $PCl_3$
  - $PCl_3 \rightarrow 5+(7 \cdot 3)=26$

* $ICl_4$
  - $ICl_4 \rightarrow 36\ e^-$
  - $\chemfig{
      Cl-I(-[:90,,2]..){\phantom{L}}
         (-[:-90,,2]..){\phantom{L}}
      -Cl
     -[::-90]Cl
     -[::-90]Cl
    }$
* $H_2SO_4$
  - $H_2SO_4 \rightarrow 2+6+4*6=32\ e^-$
  - 

## Which statement is always true according to VSEPR theory?

* The shape of a molecule is determined only by repulsions among bonding electron groups.
* The shape of a molecule is determined only by repulsions among nonbonding electron groups.
* The shape of a molecule is determined by the polarity of its bonds.
* The shape of a molecule is determined by repulsions among all electron groups on the central atom (or interior atoms, if there is more than one).

# Predicting Molecular Geometry

* Use the tables to determine the shape and bond angles.

# Molecular Polarity

Net dipole moment

![](./images/fwBv0PZ5lDmMq7F6Ex1OgmbO8gHghfnlG.png)

![](./images/fwGmxEIeEO2YygNwiiC0YG8GzxANT0GWo.png)

The H— Cl bond is polar. The bonding electrons are pulled toward the Cl end of the molecule. The net result is a polar molecule.

# Molecular Polarity

 No net dipole moment

![](./images/fbM1f6hYF4c8uO7GdeWvRp6FuGQVH5nP3.png)

![](./images/faKpCwidXEgbYxCHnXLeVndqDEFbzXuDa.png)

The O— C bond is polar. The bonding electrons are pulled equally toward both O ends of the molecule. The net result is a nonpolar molecule.

# Molecular Polarity

Net dipole moment

![](./images/foHpgsdT6LOMVYbryhkGagxrK3hS2L4vh.png)

The H—- O bond is polar. Both sets of bonding electrons are pulled toward the O end of the molecule. Because the molecule is bent, not linear, the net result is a polar molecule.

Electronegativity Difference

# and Bond Type

·If the difference in electronegativity between bonded atoms is O, the bond is pure covalent oEqual sharing, also nonpolar

·lf the difference in electronegativity between bonded atoms is 0.1 to 0.4, the bond is nonpolar covalent

· If the difference in electronegativity between bonded atoms is 0.4 to 1.9 the bond is polar covalent · If the difference in electronegativity between bonded atoms is equal to 2.0 or higher, the bond is ionic
