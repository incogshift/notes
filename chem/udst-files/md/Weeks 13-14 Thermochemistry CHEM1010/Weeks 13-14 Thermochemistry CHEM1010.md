# Thermochemistry

Thermochemistry is the study of the relationships between Chemistry and Energy.

CO2(g) + 2H20(1) + 882. 0 kJ CH4(g) + 202(g)

Heat produced = 890.3 KJ

THERMOCHEMISTRY: branchof chemistry that studies how heat changes in chemical reactions or physical state changes $\mathcal{S}\leftrightarrow\mathcal{I}\leftrightarrow\mathcal{g})$

HEAT: Energy that moves between 2 objects - Symbol: q -Unit: J or kJ

![](./images/fX1CFhvGbkhfARHDn44fgearvaVtLy0iL.png)

# 7.2 Thermochemistry

## Energy is the ability to do work.

TheSI unit of energy is the joule $(\boldsymbol{J})$ -An older, non-SI unit is The calorie (cal). $[ 1\textit{ cal}= 4. 184\textit{ J}]$

Work: Energy transferred by force to cause an object with mass to move over some distance.

$$w=F\cdot d$$

where w is work $(J=N.m$, ， $F$ is the force $(\boldsymbol{N}ewton=Kg.m/s^{2}$, ,and $d$ is the distance (meter) over which the force is exerted

Energy is either Kinetic (KE)_ or Potential (PE).

PE is the energy stored in an object due to its position or chemical composition KE is the energy an object has because of its motion.

# Forms of Energy

1. RADIANT ENERGY: Radiant energy is a form of kinetic energy that's created when electromagnetic waves travel through space.

# Law of Conservation of Energy

-Energy can be converted from one form to another -Energy cannot be created or destroyed Examples: -Electricity > lightbulb (radiant energy) -Food (chemical energy) → Movement (kinetic energy)

V When energy is transferred between objects or converted from one form to another, the total amount of energy present at the beginning must be present at the end.

# Units of Energy

- A joule (J) is the amount of energy needed to move a 1-kilogram mass at a distance of 1 meter.

$$\mathbf{J=1N\cdot m=1kg\cdot m^2/s^2}$$

- A calorie (cal) is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water 1 °Celsius.

  - kcal = energy needed to raise 1000 grams of water $1^\circ$ Celsius 
  - Food Calories = kcals

TABLE 7.1 | Energy Conversion Factors*

$1 \text { calorie (cal)} = 4.184 \text{ joules (J)}$

$1 \text { Calorie (Cal) or kilocalorie (kcal)} = 1000 \text{ cal} = 4184 \text{ J}$

$1 \text { kilowatt-hour (kWh)} = 3.60 \times 10^6 \text{ J}$
*Allconversion factors in this table are exact.

# Law of Thermodynamics:Law of Conservation of Energy

Thermodynamics is the study of energy and its interconversions

The first law of thermodynamics is the law of conservation of energy
  - The total amount of energy in the universe is constant

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be converted from one form to another, but cannot be created or destroyed. The sum of the energy changes is zero.

$$\Delta E_{\text{sys}} + \Delta E_{\text{surr}} = 0 \implies \Delta E_{\text{sys}} = - \Delta E_{\text{surr}}$$

$\Delta E$ is the change in the internal energy. "sys” and “sur” denote system and surroundings, respectively $\Delta E$ = $E_\mathrm{f} - E_\mathrm{i}$ ; the difference in the energies of the initial and final states.

### System and Surroundings

The **system** includes the molecules we want to study (here, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules)

![](./images/fAAKdoXsAM5MbNgUzYEDR1Q0SayZlY2sI.png)

The surroundings are everything else (here, the cylinder and piston)

We study the exchange of energy between the system and the surroundings

Universe = System + Surroundings

### Chemical Reactions

When we study a chemical reaction, we consider the system to be the reactants and products.

The surroundings are the vessel (beaker, test tube, flask) in which the reaction takes place plus the air or other material in thermal contact with the reaction system.

![](./images/fsbu0oRPgCgRYgGQ5IFIRdZvrnG9eIsco.png)

# Systems can be:

||||
|---|---|---|
| **Open System** | **Closed System** | **Isolated System** |
| Mass and Energy can transfer between the System and the Surroundings | Energy can transfer between the System and the Surroundings, but NOT mass | Neither Mass nor Energy can transfer between the System and the Surroundings |
|![](image.png)|![](image-1.png)|![](image-2.png)|

# Internal Energy

The internal energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of

all of the particles that compose the system

The change in the internal energy of a system depends only on the amount of energy in the system at the beginning and end - state function Only depends on the difference

![](./images/fkg79Evizwv6QBE2g1KTphIEifVLIWKZA.png)

# State Function

To reach the top of the mountain there are two trails:
- Long and winding 
- Short but steep

Regardless of the trail, when you reach the top, you will be 10,000 ft above the base.

The distance from the base to the peak of the mountain is a **state function**. It depends only on the difference in elevation between the base and the peak, not on how you arrive there!

A **State Function**: Change in altitude depends only on the difference between the initial and final values, not on the path taken.

# Changes in internal energy

![](./images/fVnQ5tmX8oAGTGOnhbGiimYb1ILTMWsSg.png)

When energy is exchanged between the system and the surroundings, it is exchanged as either heat $(\boldsymbol{q})$ or work $(w)$

That is,

$$\Delta E=q+w$$

### △E, q, w, and their signs

![](./images/fwaV1otpSOvGfkT82aBvtXVduubNhGhoI.png)

# Energy Exchange

Energy is exchanged between the system and surroundings through heat and work

- $q=$ heat (thermal) energy

![](./images/f5pod9ewxZRM7RBvmC6czlygyC6vqA4Zz.png)

- $w=$ work energy

- $q$ and $w$ are not state functions; their value depends on the process.

$$\Delta E=q+w$$

||||
| --- | --- | --- |
| $q$ (heat) | + system gains thermal energy | - system loses thermal energy |
| $w$ (work) | + work done on the system | - work done by the system |
| $\Delta E$ (change in internal energy) | + energy flows into the system | - energy flows out of the system |

# Energy Flow in a Chemical Reaction

|Exothermic |Endothermic|
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Heat of system decreases (E lost)                   |  Heat of system increases (E added)                  |

 Energy is exchanged between the system and surroundings through either heat exchange or work being done.



# Energy Flow in a Chemical Reaction

- Generally, we are not concerned with the absolute or total energy (E) of a system, but rather with change in E

- Consider the exchange of energy between the system and surroundings

Two possibilities:

System adds E $(\mathrm{E}_\text{sys}\uparrow)$ ; surroundings loses E $(\mathrm{E}_\text{sur}\downarrow)$ >System loses E $:(\mathbb{E}_\text{sys}\downarrow)$ ; surroundings gain E (Esur t)

- Always consider the perspective of the system >E increases $(\uparrow)=+$ve energy change

E decreases $(\downarrow)=$ -ve energy change

# How is heat flow and its magnitude measured?

The heat flow in a reaction is measured by a device known as a calorimeter.

| Constant Pressure (Coffee Cup Calorimeter) | Constant Volume (Bomb Calorimeter) |

## Calorimetry at Constant Pressure - The Coffee-Cup

### The Coffee-Cup Calorimeter

The calorimetry contains water or Other materials of known specific heat capacity $(\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{s}})$

A coffee cup calorimeter measures enthalpy changes for chemical reactions in solution.

The wall of the calorimeter are insulated so that there is no exchange of heat with the surrounding air.

![](./images/fKVnYe5gyCVuFpv4gVtsP8cGttXefALLa.png)

Reactions carried out in aqueous solution are at constant pressure. Open to the atmosphere

# Specific Heat Capacity

Measure of a substance's intrinsic ability to absorb heat.

The specific heat capacity is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance 1 °Celsius. $-C_s$ Units J / (g ℃Celsius)

The molar heat capacity is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of one mole of a substance 1 °Celsius.

Long heating/cooling timeUse as coolant

Note the tremendous difference in Specific Heat.

Water's value is VERY HIGH.

Water (g)=1.87 Water $(s)=2.06$

The larger amount of water absorbing heat from the air keeps beaches cool in the summer.

![](./images/fcBRBkpMaTec3PhD1e2slMbkBCkECNGh6.png)

Note: q is a negative value for the system, therefore Energy decreases and the heat is released from the system. The heat is transferred to the surroundings.

# 7.5 Measuring $\Delta E$: Calorimetry at Constant Volume

Because $\Delta E=q+w$ we can determine △E by measuring q and w

Easiest to do a process in such a way that there is no change in volume, so w = 0
- At constant volume, $\Delta E$ system $=q$ system'

 In practice, we cannot observe the temperature changes of the individual chemicals involved in a reaction, so instead we measure the temperature change in the surroundings.

- Use insulated, controlled surroundings.

q system $=-q$ Surroundingse

The surrounding area is called a bomb calorimeter and is usually made of a sealed, insulated container filled with water

$$q_{\mathrm{surroundings}}=q_{\mathrm{calorimeter}}=-q_{\mathrm{system}}$$

# Constant Volume Calorimetry

![](./images/fiu3aKk2uLgMAmND9SGcR49XinGY0GCoP.png)

Calorimetry is used to measure thermal energy exchanged between reaction and surroundings

 A bomb calorimeter has a constant volume and is used to measure △E for combustion reactions

 The heat capacity of the calorimeter is the amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter for each degree rise in temperature and is called the calorimeter constant. Ccal, kJ/Celsius

# 7.6 Enthalpy

- The enthalpy, H, of a system is the sum of the internal energy of the system and the product of pressure and volume.
$$H=E+PV$$
- H is a state function. △H = △E + P△V

 The enthalpy change, △H, of a reaction is the heat involved in a reaction at constant pressure
$$\begin{aligned}
&\Delta H& =\:\Delta E\:+\:P\Delta V \\
&&=\:(q_{\mathrm{p}}+w)\:+\:P\Delta V \\

# Measuring AE calculation

EXAMPLE: When 1 mol liquid $\mathrm{H}_2$O is boiled at 100° C and 1.0 atm pressure, its volume expands from 19.8 mL in the liquid state to 30.16 L in the gaseous state. The heat energy absorbed by the vaporization $(\mathrm{q}_{\mathrm{p}})$ process is found experimentally to be 40.67 kJ. Calculate the increase in internal energy $\Delta E$ of $\mathrm{H}_2$O . Given that Step 1: Convert Volumes to $\Delta V$

Given:

Initial volume $(V_{\text{initial}})=$ 19.8 mL = 0.0198 L (converted to liters),

-Final volume $(V_{\mathrm{final}})=30.16$

$$\Delta V=V_\mathrm{final}-V_\mathrm{initial}=30.16\:\mathrm{L}-0.0198\:\mathrm{L}=30.1402\:\mathrm{L}$$

To calculate the increase in internal energy (△E) for the vaporization of 1 mole of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$O, we use the relationship between enthalpy change $(\Delta H)$ and internal energy change $(\Delta E)$

### Step 2: Calculate $P\Delta V$ in Joules

To convert the work term $P\Delta V$ to joules,use the conversion factor1L $\cdot$atm=101.325 J

$$\Delta H=\Delta E+P\Delta V$$

$$P\Delta V=(1.0\:\mathrm{atm})\times(30.1402\:\mathrm{L})\times(101.325\:\mathrm{J/L}\cdot\mathrm{atm})=3051.24\:\mathrm{J}=3.051\:\mathrm{kJ}$$

where:

### Step 3: Solve for $\Delta E$

。$\Delta H$ is the enthalpy change (heat absorbed at constant pressure), which is given as 40.67 kJ,

Rearrange the equation to find $\Delta E$

. $P$ is the pressure, which is 1.0 atm . $\Delta V$ is the change in volume, calculated as the difference between the final and initial volumes

$$\Delta E=\Delta H-P\Delta V\\\Delta E=40.67\:\mathrm{kJ}-3.051\:\mathrm{kJ}=37.619\:\mathrm{kJ}$$

### Answer:

## Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions

When △H is positive, heat is being absorbed by the system - endothermic reaction

- When △H is negative, heat is being released by the system: exothermic reaction

The value of △H for a chemical reaction is the amount of heat absorbed or evolved in the reaction under conditions of constant pressure

# Measuringe $\Delta H_\mathrm{rxn}$ in a Coffee-Cup Calorimeter

Magnesium metal reacts with hydrochloric acid according to the balanced equation:

$$\mathrm{Mg}(s)\:+\:2\:\mathrm{HCl}(aq)\:\longrightarrow\:\mathrm{MgCl}_{2}(aq)\:+\:\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)$$

In an experiment to determine the enthalpy change for this reaction, 0.158 g of $Mg$ metal is combined with enough HCl to make 100.0 mL of solution in a coffee-cup calorimeter. The HCl is sufficiently concentrated so that the $Mg$ completely reacts. The temperature of the solution rises from $25.6°C$ to 32.8 ॰C as a result of the reaction. Find $\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}$ for the reaction as written. Use 1.00 g/mL as the density of the solution and $C_{\mathrm{s,~soln}}=4.18$ J/g$\cdot$°C as the specific heat capacity of the solution.

### Solution

$$\begin{aligned}
&\iota_{\mathrm{soln}}=\:100.0\:\mathrm{mL}\:\mathrm{soln}\times\frac{1.00\:\mathrm{g}}{1\:\mathrm{mL}\:\mathrm{soln}}=\:1.00\times10^{2}\:\mathrm{g}&& \Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}} && =\frac{q_{\mathrm{rxn}}}{\mathrm{mol~Mg}}  \\
&T=T_{\mathrm{f}}-T_{\mathrm{i}} \\
&_{\mathrm{soln}}=m_{\mathrm{soln}}\times C_{\mathrm{s,~soln}}\times\Delta T =32.8°\mathrm{C}-25.6°\mathrm{C}=7.2°\mathrm{C} && =\frac{-3.0\times10^3\text{J}}{0.158\text{g Mg}\times\frac{1\text{ mo}}{24.31}}  \\
&=1.00\times10^{2}\:\mathrm{g}\times4.18\frac{\mathrm{J}}{\mathrm{g}\cdot\mathrm{C}}\times7.2\:\mathrm{C}=3.0\times10^{3}\:\mathrm{J}&& \mathrm{Mg}(s) && =-4.6\times10^5\text{J/mol M} && +2\operatorname{HCl}(aq)\longrightarrow\operatorname{MgC} 
\end{aligned}$$

$$C_{s,\:soln}=4.18\:\mathrm{J/g}\cdot^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$$

Hn=-4.610J

$$q_{\mathrm{rxn}}=-q_{\mathrm{soln}}=-3.0\times10^3\text{J}$$

## Rules of Theromchemistry

1. Enthalpy changes depend on the amount of substance undergoing chemical change.

2. Doubling all coefficients of the balanced equation doubles the enthalpy change.

3. For the reveres reaction △H has the same magnitude but the opposite sign.

4. All processes are exothermic (△H negative) and endothermic (△H positive)

5. The value of △H for a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or in a series of steps.

# 7.8 Relationships Involving Hrxn

When a reaction is multiplied by a factor, △Hxn is multiplied by that factor - △Hxn is extensive

$$\mathrm{C}(s)+\mathrm{~O}_2(g)\to\mathrm{CO}_2(g)\quad\Delta H=-393.5\mathrm{~kJ}\\\mathrm{C}(s)+2\mathrm{~O}_2(g)\to2\mathrm{~CO}_2(g)\quad\Delta H=2(-393.5\mathrm{~kJ})=$$
787.0 kJ

If a reaction is reversed, then the sign of △H is reversed, too

$$\mathrm{CO}_2(g)\to\mathrm{C}(s)+\mathrm{~O}_2(g)\quad\Delta H=\mathrm{~+393.5~kJ}$$

## Learning Check

Consider the following chemical equation:

$$2\mathrm{~A+B\to C}\quad\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}=122\mathrm{~J}$$

What is △Hxn for the reaction 2 C$\to4$ A+2 B?

a.122 J b. -122 J C.244 J d. -244 J

### Hess's Law

 △H is well known for many reactions, and it is inconvenient to measure △H for every reaction in which we are interested.

However, we can estimate △H using △H values that are published and the properties of enthalpy.

Hess's law states that "If a reaction is carried out in a series of steps, △H for the overall reaction will be equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps."

# 7.9 Standard Conditions

- The standard state is the state of a material at a defined set of conditions. - Pure gas at exactly 1 atm pressure

- Pure solid or liquid in its most stable form at exactly 1 atm pressure and temperature of interest - Usually 25 °Celsius - Substance in a solution with a concentration 1 M

The standard enthalpy change, △H°, is the enthalpy change when all reactants and products are in their standard states.

. The standard enthalpy of formation, $\Delta H_\mathrm{f}^{\circ}$ , is the enthalpy change for the reaction forming 1 mole of a pure compound from its constituent elements - the elements must be in their standard states

- The△ Hfor a pure element in its standard state =0 kJ/mol 68

### Standard Enthalpies of Formation

Ag(s, 25 °C) + 1/2 Cl,(g , 25 °C, 1 atm) AgCl (s, 25 °C) AH = -127.1 KJ

It follows that:

△H°fAgCI(s) = -127.1 KJ/mol

"f"stands for formation

## Formation Reactions

Reactions of elements in their standard state to form 1 mole of a pure compound

If you are not sure what the standard state of an element is, find the form in Appendix IIB that has
$$\Delta H_{\mathfrak{f}}^\circ=0.$$

Because the definition requires 1 mole of compound be made, the coefficients of the reactants may be fractions.

Calculating Standard Enthalpy Change for a

Any reaction can be written as the sum of formation reactions (or the reverse of formation reactions) for the reactants and products.

The △H for the reaction is then the sum of the $\Delta H_\mathrm{f}^{\circ}$ for the component reactions.

AH =nAH, (products)- nH, (reactants)

Z means sum.

n is the coefficient of the reaction.
