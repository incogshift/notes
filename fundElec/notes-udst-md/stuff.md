The circuit shown in **your Figure 10.5** (with 5 kΩ and 10 kΩ in series across a 15 V supply and capacitors in parallel) **does exist in the book**.

### ✅ Book Match:
It is found in **Chapter 10: Capacitors**, specifically in:
- **Section 10.4** – “Voltage Divider with Capacitors”  
- **Page: 386**, under:
  > **"See Figure 10.5. What is the voltage across the 5 μF capacitor after each capacitor has charged to its final value?"**

### ⚡ Book’s Approach (Summary):

The book treats the **final state** of capacitors in a DC network as **open circuits**. This allows voltage division using the resistors only. The capacitors are ignored in the final (steady-state) analysis.

Here’s how the book solves it:

1. **Total resistance:**  
   $$
   R_{\text{total}} = 5\text{ kΩ} + 10\text{ kΩ} = 15\text{ kΩ}
   $$

2. **Current division is not needed**, because capacitors block DC once fully charged.

3. **Voltage across 10 kΩ resistor (which the 5 μF capacitor is across):**  
   Use voltage divider:
   $$
   V_{5\mu F} = V_{R_{10k}} = 15V \cdot \frac{10\text{ kΩ}}{15\text{ kΩ}} = 10V
   $$

4. **Final Answer:**
   $$
   \boxed{V_{5\mu F} = 10\,\text{V}}
   $$
