# Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations

**Chemical reaction**: one or more substances (matter) are converted into one or more different ones (new type matter)

**Combustion reaction**: a type of chemical reaction in which a substance combines with oxygen to form one or more oxygen-containing compounds with the release of heat

## Signs of a Chemical Reaction

- Change in temperature
  - Reaction feels hot or cold
  - You might see fire -- Reactions that feel warm are **exothermic** 
  - Reactions that feel cold are called **endothermic**
- Formation of color or light
- Formation of solid or gas

# Chemical Reactions

We can write reactions in an equation:

Example

$$\mathrm{2Na+Cl_2 \to 2NaCl}$$

sodium + chlorine $\to$ sodium chloride

![](./images/fYKzwFTtxyArvkLHuoUug7dPgYDKWMoCK.png)

## Chemical Equations

- Shorthand way of describing a reaction

Products $\to$ Reactants

- Provides information about the reaction
  - Formulas of reactants and products
  - States of reactants and products
  - Relative numbers of reactant and product molecules that are required can be used to determine weights of reactants used and products that can be made

## Chemical Equations

Example

$$\mathrm{CH_4 + O_2 \longrightarrow CO_2 + H_2O}$$

reactants productse

$$\mathrm{CH_{4(g)} + O_{2(g)} \longrightarrow CO_{2(g)} + H_2O_{(g)}}$$

TABLE 4.1 States of. Reactants and Products in Chemical Equations

| Abbreviation | State |
|--------------|-------|
| (g)     | Gas  |
| (l)     | Liquid|
| (s)     | Solid |
| (aq)     | Aqueous (water solution) |

For elements that are alone, the periodic table will tell us the element's state..

## Predicting Precipitation Reactions

![](image-1.png)

## Law of Conservation of Mass

The LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MASS says that mass cannot be created or destroyed This means:

Mass of reactants = Mass of products

**Example: Combustion of Methane**

Methane gas burns to produce carbon dioxide gas and gaseous water

Whenever something burns, it combines with $\mathrm{O}_2(g)$

$$\mathrm{CH_{4(g)} + O_{2(g)} \longrightarrow CO_{2(g)} + H_{2}O_{(g)}}$$

If you look closely, you should immediately spot a problem

![](./images/fgF0ZMGMQukdMh93ACYgnYIlwuFEUSGdh.png)


Also: four H atoms on the left, only two H toms on the right

![](./images/fawkxMfUbQygWuyCCB9e3MaqduolAMnlN.png)

To correct these problems, we must balance the equation

We do this by changing the coefficients, not the subscripts

All chemical reactions MUST obey the Law of Conservation of Mass (the equation must be balanced)

We adjust the numbers of molecules, so there are equal numbers of atoms of each element on both sides of the arrow

**Note: Never change the subscripts**

$$\mathrm{CO_{2(g)} + 2 H_{2}O_{(g)} \longrightarrow CH_{4(g)} + 2 O_{2(g)}}$$

![](./images/f0T7RLq89o3CFwkPunpEAnkF708WcIGuL.png)

Number of atoms on both sides are now equal - the equation is balanced.

# Useful Tips

- You can only change the reaction coefficients, not the subscripts
- You may use trial-and-error methods
- Change coefficients for compounds (e.g., $CO_2$) before changing coefficients for elements (e.g., $O_2$)
- Treat polyatomic ions that appear on both sides of an equation (e.g., $CO_3^{2-}$ or $PO_4^{3-}$) as units, rather than counting their atoms individually
- First balance the atoms that occur in only one substance in each side of the equation
- Count carefully, make sure to recount after each coefficient change
- Write the balanced equation in the final form and do a reality check.
- Train yourself by doing more problems


# Chemical Reactions

CHEMICAL REACTIONS are when elements or compounds react to form new chemicals 
  - Old bonds break
  - New bonds form

Chemical Reactions

![](./images/fR85ZkVTro3xNnEMmcGC5I5TIgOZswQxl.png)

## Combination Reactions

![](./images/fN31ZiXI8s4z5o8daRGGFE2BkWl3ovObf.png)

- COMBINATION REACTIONS are the opposite of decomposition reactions. 
- Two chemicals (or more) react to form one big compound
- There is only one product.

Also called: composition or synthesis reaction

![](./images/fpvOnh84t5QghwI5S7STZlgIciGCeioHP.png)

The reactions become progressively more vigorous as we move down the group.

### Alkali Metal Reactions

Reactions of alkali metals with nonmetals are vigorous
- Sodium and chlorine form sodium chloride.

$$\mathrm{2 Na_{(s)} + Cl_{2(g)} \longrightarrow 2 NaCl_{(s)}}$$

Alkali metals also react with water to form the dissolved alkali metal ion, the hydroxide ion, and hydrogen gas

$$\mathrm{2 M_{(s)} + 2 H_2O_{(l)} \longrightarrow 2 M^+_{(aq)} + 2 OH^-_{(aq)} + H_{2(g)}}$$

Here $\mathrm{M}$ is an alkali metal 

### Elements

$$\mathrm{4 Na_{(s)} + O_{2(g)} \longrightarrow 2 Na_2O_{(s)}}$$

When your reactants are two elements, your product will be one compound.

- If the compound is ionic, you can use ions' charges to find the formula.
- If the compound is covalent, you need more information to find the formula.

### Metal oxide & Non-metal oxide

$$\mathrm{Na_2O_{(s)} + H_2O_{(l)} \longrightarrow 2 NaOH_{(aq)}}$$

When your reactants are a metal oxide and water, your product will be a BASE.

$$\mathrm{SO_{3(g)} + H_2O_{(l)} \longrightarrow H_2SO_{4(aq)}}$$

When reactants are a nonmetal oxide and water, your product will be an ACID.

### Hydrates

$$\mathrm{CuSO_{4(s)} + 5 H_2O_{(l)} \longrightarrow CuSO_4 \cdot 5 H_2O_{(s)}}$$

When your reactants are any other ionic compound and water, your product will be a HYDRATE.

- The reaction will already be balanced

### Halogen Reactions

- Halogens all react with many metals to form metal halides. 

$$\mathrm{2 Fe_{(s)} + 3 Cl_{2(g)} \longrightarrow 2 FeCl_{3(s)}}$$

- They also react with hydrogen to form hydrogen halides

$$\mathrm{H}_{2(g)} + \mathrm{X}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{HX}_{(g)}$$

- Also react with each other to form interhalogen compounds

$$\mathrm{Br_{2(l)} + F_{2(g)} \longrightarrow 2 BrF_{(g)}}$$

![](./images/fZIgQCuedkMyBG4pm5MskBL8EScvrq2ll.png)

## Decomposition Reactions

![](image-2.png)

DECOMPOSITION REACTIONS are the opposite of combination reactions

One reactant becomes 2 or more products Always only one reactant.

Reactants decompose into:
- Elements
- Carbonates
- Hydrates

### Elements

$$\mathrm{2 AlCl_{3(s)} \longrightarrow 2 Al_{(s)} + 3 Cl_{2(g)}}$$

When the reactant is a BINARY ionic compound, the products will be both elements alone.

- Metallic element, $\mathrm{Al(s)}$
- Non-metallic element, $\mathrm{Cl_{2(g)}}$

### Hydrates

$$\mathrm{CuSO_4 \cdot 5 H_2O_{(s)} \longrightarrow CuSO_{4(s)} + 5 H_2O_{(g)}}$$

When the reactant is a HYDRATE, the products will be water and the anhydrous compound.

### Carbonates

When a metal carbonate compound is heated, it will decompose to give $\mathrm{CO_{2(g)}}$ and a metal oxide

$$\mathrm{CuCO_{3(s)} \longrightarrow CO_{2(g)} + CuO_{(s)}}$$

### Hydrocarbon Combustion

Combustion reactions involve compounds reacting with $\mathrm{O_{2(g)}}$ to produce heat.

A HYDROCARBON is a compound that contains only carbon and hydrogen

Example: (methane) $\mathrm{CH_4}$ (benzene) $\mathrm{C_6H_6}$

### Hydrocarbon Combustion

![](./images/fPGHDsB5L48rDzaoQGEXNGSzw90kG4Pzg.png)

![](./images/fAHzzZpcRbQkeGG7mgH3IVBWORIfgBtel.png)

HYDROCARBON COMBUSTION is a reaction between a hydrocarbon compound and $\mathrm{O_2}$ to produce $\mathrm{CO_2 + H_2O}$

$$\mathrm{C_4H_{8(g)} + 6 O_{2(g)} \longrightarrow 4 CO_{2(g)} + 4 H_2O_{(g)}}$$

## Single Replacement

![](./images/f7ucFkXpXHTdaXtELFqTwCfDGnE44Ff09.png)

![](./images/fTggfx9lhKawrZ12ZuoqK2MavgTSOUQUc.png)

* One element is replaced:
    - Metals replace metals (Activity Series)
    - Nonmetals replace nonmetals (Periodic table)

![](./images/fYsOqnQZlDoes0c6gqaEvN1B6LxTrtVlw.png)

* Not all reactions occur
    - The replacing element must be stronger than the element in the compound

![](./images/f6xICKqESglU46MX2uc5ewPoAG60oZkRr.png)

We can tell which metal is stronger using the ACTIVITY SERIES: (Data Book, p.5)


* Li (s) + NaCl(aq) LiCl (aq) + Na (s)
    - Li is more reactive than Na

* Ni (s) + ZnCl2 (aq) →
    - Ni is less reactive than Zn
NR

A metal atom will replace any metal below it in the activity series.

### Single Replacement

Note: Some metals will replace H+ in acids or water:

Ca(s) + 2 H20 (①) → Ca(OH)2 (aq) + H2(g)

Mg (s) + 2 HCl (aq) MgCl (aq) + H2 ()

![](./images/ftBR4wLLUCmuiXAsv7T3G9kZO1aLXzbTe.png)

Note the position of H in the Activity Series

# Single Replacement

4.0 With halogens, the PERIODIC TABLE will 18.998403 tell you which one is stronger? 173.2 cl 35.453 a) Cl2 (g) + 2 KI (aq) → 2 KCI (aq) + l2 (s) 353.0 Br 79.90453 NR b) KF (aq) + Br2 (1) → 2.7126.90447 A non-metal halogen, will replace a halide ion below it in the PERODIC TABLE

### Concept Check

Predict the products for these reactions, and write the BCE:

a) AlBr3 (aq) + Fe (s) → NR

b) 2 Na (s) + 2 H20 () → 2 Na0H(aq) + H2 (g)

BaF2 (s) + Cl2 (g) c) F2(g) +BaCl2 (aq) →

## Double Replacement

![](./images/fmRlhRo0cIeLaeS8TuBzcdzXU1AYq2Ha4.png)

* **REPLACEMENT DOUBLE** or **Double Displacement** reactions have two ionic compounds reacting to form two new ionic compounds.
* Metals will switch with each other
* Strength does not matter because no element will be alone.
* **Note**: Cation replaces cation Anion replaces anion

## Double replacement

![](./images/f6hBSyYY5ZmExq20fvxlgPiWRvDNYFVCS.png)

## Precipitation Reactions

Precipitation reactions are ones in which a solid forms

when we mix two solutions

Reactions between aqueous solutions of ionic compounds produce an ionic compound that is insoluble in water

The insoluble product is called a precipitate

 Precipitation reaction is responsible for water hardness

Diminishes effectiveness of soap

$$^+(aq)\:+\:\mathrm{CO}_3^{2-}(aq)\:\longrightarrow\mathrm{MgCO}_3(s\\^+(aq)\:+\:\mathrm{CO}_3^{2-}(aq)\:\longrightarrow\mathrm{CaCO}_3(s)$$

## Conceptual Connection

The presence of one of the following ions within a compound indicates that a compound is soluble with no exceptions Which ion?

a.OHb. SO42- c. NO3

## Representing Aqueous Reactions

An equation showing the complete neutral formulas for

each compound in the aqueous reaction as if they existed as molecules is called a molecular equation

2 KC $\mathcal{H}(aq)+\mathcal{M}g(\mathcal{N}\mathcal{O}_3)_2\left(aq\right)\to2\operatorname{KNO}_3\left(a\right.$ q)+Mg(OH),(s)

In actual solutions of soluble ionic compounds, dissolved substances are present as ions

Equations that describe the nature of the dissolved species in solution are called complete ionic equations

61

# Writing a Complete lonic Equation

- Aqueous strong electrolytes (soluble salts, strong acids, strong bases) are written as ions
- Weak Insoluble and electrolytes, substances, nonelectrolytes are written in molecule form
- Solids, liquids, and gases are not dissolved, hence written in molecule form

$$\begin{aligned}2 K^+(aq) + 2\mathrm{OH}^{-}(aq)+\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}(aq)+2\mathrm{~NO}_{3}^{-}(aq)&\to 2\mathrm{~K}^{+}(aq)+2\mathrm{~NO}_{3}^{-}(aq)+\mathrm{N}\end{aligned}$$

## lonic Equation

- In the complete ionic equation, some of the ions in solution appear unchanged on both sides of the equation.
- These ions are called spectator ions
  - Because they do not participate in the reaction (soluble salts, strong acids, and strong bases)

![](./images/faNxoqTvlNR33o9dmqPeVD7MqSS9PHFnq.png)

## Net lonic Equation

- An ionic equation in which the spectator ions are removed is called a net ionic equation.

$Pb2+ (aq (2)+2NQ_{\mathrm{~a}}^-(aq)+2K^+(aq)+2 Cl^- (aq)→ \mathrm{PbCl}_2(s)+2 K^+(aq)+2 N\mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{a}}^-(a 9)$

The net ionic equation is

$$\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\begin{pmatrix}aq\end{pmatrix}+2\mathrm{~Cl}^-\begin{pmatrix}aq\end{pmatrix}\to\mathrm{PbCl}_2\begin{pmatrix}s\end{pmatrix}$$

# Summarizing Aqueous Equations.

- A molecular equation is a chemical equation showing the complete, neutral formulas for every compound in the reaction
- A complete ionic equation is a chemical equation showing all of the species as they are actually present in solution: strong electrolytes are therefore represented as their component ions
- A net ionic equation is an equation showing only the species that actually change during the reaction

### Gas-Evolution Reactions

- Some reactions form a gas directly from the ion exchange

$$\mathrm{SO}_4(aq)+\mathrm{Li}_2\mathrm{S}(aq)\to\mathrm{Li}_2\mathrm{SO}_4(aq)+$$

- Other reactions form a gas by the subsequent decomposition of one of the ion exchange products into a gas and water

$$HCl(aq)+NaHCO_3(aq) \to NaCl(aq)+H_2CO_3(aq)$$
$$H_2CO_3(ag) \to H_2O(1) + CO_2(g)$$

$$\mathrm{NaHCO}_3(aq)+\mathrm{HCl}(aq) \to \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(l)+\mathrm{NaCl}(aq)+\mathrm{CO}_2(g)$$

When aqueous sodium

## Types of Compounds That Undergo Evolution Reactions

| Reactant Type | Intermediate Product | Gas Evolved | Example |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------|---------|
| Sulfides      | None                 | H₂S         | 2 HCl(aq) + K₂S(aq) → H₂S(g) + 2 KCl(aq) |
| Carbonates and Bicarbonates | H₂CO₃        | CO₂         | 2 HCl(aq) + K₂CO₃(aq) → H₂O(l) + CO₂(g) + 2 KCl(aq) |
| Sulfites and Bisulfites | H₂SO₃        | SO₂         | 2 HCl(aq) + K₂SO₃(aq) → H₂O(l) + SO₂(g) + 2 KCl(aq) |
| Ammonium      | NH₄OH                | NH₃         | $NH_4Cl(aq) + KOH(aq) → H_2O(l) + NH_3(g) + KCl(aq)$ |

### Concept Check

Predict the products. Write NR if there is no reaction.

a) NaCI(aq)> AgCl(gy+ NaNO3 (ag) AgNO3 (aq) +

b) MgCO3 (s) + 2 HNO3 (aq) → Mg(NOs)2(aq) + CO2(g + H20 ()

c) BaCl2 (aq) →Ba(OH)2(s + 2NHCl(a) NH4OH (aq) +

# Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions

## Mole Ratio

Balanced equations tell us the recipe of a reaction. - It tells us how many moles of each chemical we need or will produce

If we know the moles of one chemical, we can use the MOLE RATIO to find the moles of another:

$$\mathrm{n_B=\frac{coefficient~B}{coefficient~A}\times n_A}$$

na is the moles of known chemical

np is the moles of the unknown chemical

**Note: This method is assumes that the other required ingredients are available in excess**

### Reaction Stoichiometry

Example: How many moles of AgCl are produced if you have 2.50 mol of MgCl,?

$$\mathrm{MgCl_2(aq) + 2 AgNO_3(aq) \to Mg(NO_3)_2(aq) + 2 AgCl(s)}$$

Coefficient of AgCl nAgCI Coefficient ofMgCl2 X nMgCl 2 AgCl x (2.50 mol MgCl2) 1 MgCl2 nAgcl = 5. 00 mol

## 4.3 Reaction Stoichiometry: How Much Carbon Dioxide?

 The balanced chemical equations for fossil-fuel combustion reactions provide the exact relationships between the amount of fossil fuel burned and the amount of carbon dioxide emitted

2 C:H:(I) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H,O(g)

V16 CO2 molecules are produced for every 2 molecules of Octane (C:H18) burned

## Quantities in Chemical Reactions

![](./images/f7YoziaSVU3R1mkP3K2fFXE7MLktmweTP.png)

- The amount of every substance used and made in a chemical reaction is related tothe amounts of all the other substances in the reaction

- Law of conservation of mass

- Balancing equations by balancing atoms

-The study of the numerical relationship between chemical quantities in a chemical reaction is called stoichiometry

### Reaction Stoichiometry

-The coefficients in a chemical reaction specify the relative amounts in moles of each substance involved in the reaction

2 CsHs(I) + 25 O2(g) →16 CO2(g)+18 H2O(g)

2 molecules of CsH1s react with 25 molecules of O2 to form 16 molecules of CO2 and 18 molecules of H20

2 moles of CsH18 react with 25 moles of O2to form 16 moles of CO2 and 18 moles of H20

2 mol CH1: : 25 mol $\mathcal{O}_2$ : 16 mol CO2 : 18 mol H,0

# Making Pizza Analogy

- The number of pizzas you can make depends on the amount of the ingredients you use.

1 crust + 5 oz tomato sauce + 2 cups cheese $\to$ 1 pizza

This relationship can be expressed mathematically

1 crust : 5 oz sauce : 2 cups cheese : 1 pizza

- We can compare the amount of pizza that can be made from 10 cups of cheese:

2 cups cheese : 1 pizza, then,

$10 \text{ cups cheese }\times\dfrac{1\mathrm{~pizza~}}{2\text{ cups cheese }}=5\mathrm{~pizzas}$

## Making Molecules: Mole-to-Mole Conversions

- We use the ratio from the balanced chemical equation in the same way that we used the ratio from the pizza recipe.

The ratio of the coefficients acts as a conversion factor between the amount in moles of the reactants and products.

2 CsH:(I) + 25 02(g) → 16 C02(g) + 18 H,0(g)

stoichiometric ratio: 2 moles $C_8H_{18}$ : 16 moles CO2

The ratio acts as a conversion factor between the amount in moles of the reactant, CsH18, and the amount in moles of the product, CO2.

### Mole-to-Mole Conversions.

-Suppose we burn 22.0 moles of CsH18; how many moles of CO2 form?

2 CH18(I) + 25 O2(g) → 16 CO2(g) + 18 H,O(g)

stoichiometric ratio: 2 moles C:H8: 16 moles CO2

22.0 mol G Ha × 16 mol CO ± =176 mol CO22 mol CH8

-The combustion of 22.0 moles of CgH18 adds 176 moles of CO2 to the atmosphere.

## Making Molecules: Mass-to-Mass

![](./images/fkzUKPvG6fZZkH7IVBCKzbubwNMgMuzug.png)

### Conversions

- The world burned the equivalent of 3.7 x 1015 g of gasoline (octane) in 2013. We can estimate the mass of CO2 produced based on the flowchart below:

![](./images/fDDVlMbFPDXoN90Mi3w2f6nM36Wwk3hzv.png)

- We use molar mass as a conversion factor between the mass given and the amount of moles

- We use coefficients as the conversion factor between the reactant, C&H18, and the amount in moles of the product, CO2, and then molar mass as the conversion factor to get the mass of cO2 produced.


# Concept Check

![](./images/fSvyCcRKuG0qVpZSVGIw5LMU75U7zdSXZ.png)

# 4.4 Limiting Reactant, Theoretical Yield, Percent Yield

- Recall our pizza recipe:

1 crust + 5 oz tomato sauce + 2 cups cheese $\to$ 1pizza

- If we have 4 crusts, 10 cups of cheese, and 15 oz tomato sauce, how many pizzas can we make?

We have enough cruststo make 4 arus 1 pza 4 pizas 1 pizza = 5 pizzas We have enough cheese to make 10 cups cheese * 2 cups cheese

We have enough tomato sauce to make

![](./images/fGf2SkwZH90HYz5CMXBgWKUhBnEtwHBGG.png)

87

# Limiting Reactant (Reagent)

-We have enough crusts for 4 pizzas, enough cheese for 5 pizzas, but enough tomato sauce for only 3 pizzas.

![](./images/fhqMSMESLDKWWxNwAzDVfXTBv3cvKpcwd.png)

We can make only three pizzas. The tomato sauce limits how many pizzas we can make.

## Theoretical Yield

- Tomato sauce is the limiting reactant, the reactant that makes the least amount of product

  - The limiting reactant is also known as the **limiting reagent**

- The maximum number of pizzas we can make depends on this ingredient. In chemical reactions, we call this the **theoretical yield**.

  - This is the amount of product that can be made in a chemical reaction based on the amount of limiting reactant

  - The ingredient that makes the least amount of pizza determines how many pizzas you can make (**theoretical yield**)

## Percent Yield

- Assume that while making pizzas, we burn a pizza, drop one on the floor, or other uncontrollable events happen so that we make only two pizzas. The actual amount of product made in a chemical reaction is called the **actual yield**.

- We can determine the efficiency of making pizzas by calculating the percentage of the maximum number of pizzas we actually make. In chemical reactions, we call this the percent yield.



# Limiting Reagent and Yield


- For reactions with multiple reactants, it is likely the reactants will be completely used before the others

- When this reactant is used up, the reaction stops, and no more product can be made.

- The reactant that limits the amount of product is called the **limiting reactant (reagent)**

- The limiting reagent gets completely consumed

-Reactants not completely consumed are called excess reactants (reagents)

The amount of product that can be made from the limiting reactant is called the theoretical yield

## In Summary:

- The limiting reactant (or limiting reagent): the reactant that is completely consumed in a chemical reaction

  - limits the amount of product

- The reactant in excess is any reactant that occurs in a quantity greater than is required to completely react with the limiting reactant

## In Summary:

The theoretical yield is the amount of product that can be made in a chemical reaction based on the amount of limiting reactant

-The actual yield is the amount of product actually produced in a chemical reaction

- The percent yield is calculated as follows:

$\mathrm{\dfrac{Actual~yield}{Theoretical~yield}} \times 100$

## Calculating Limiting Reactant Theoretical Yield, and % Yield

- Recall our balanced equation for CH4 combustion:

CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)

This equation implies that:

-- every molecule of CH4 reacts with two molecules of O2

CH4(g) + 2 02(g) →CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)

## Combustion of Methane

-If we have five molecules of CH4 and eight molecules of O2, which is the limiting reactant?

CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) +2 H2O(g)

-First we calculate the number of CO2 molecules that can be made from five CH4 molecules.

1 CO25 CH4 X 5CO21 CH4

# Combustion of Methane

Then we calculate the number of cO2 molecules that can be made from eight O2 molecules.

We have enough CH4 to make 4 CO2 molecules, but the available O2 can only give 4 CO2 molecules

Therefore, O2 is the limiting reactant, and four CO2 molecules is the theoretical yield

- CH4 is in excess

## Calculating Limiting Reactant

Theoretical Yield, and % Yield from Reactant Masses

-When working in the lab, we normally measure reactant quantities in grams

To find the limiting reactant and theoretical yield, we must first convert grams to moles

## Calculating Limiting Reactant

Theoretical Yield, and % Yield from Reactant Masses.

- A reactant mixture contains 42.5 grams of Mg and 33.8 grams of O2. What is the limiting reactant and theoretical yield?

$$\mathrm{2Mg_{(S)}+O_2 \to 2MgO}$$
