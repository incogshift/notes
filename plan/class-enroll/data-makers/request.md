Here is a list of available courses.

I want a schedule for one college student where:

- My classes are **mostly** on **Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday** (preferred but not mandatory).
- My **desired start time** is **8 AM**.
- I have **no preference for an ending time**.
- I want a **0.5-1 hour break** between **12 PM - 3 PM for Dhuhr**, but **only if needed** (if classes end before 3 PM, no break).
- I want a **0.5-1 hour break** between **3 PM - 6 PM for Asr**, but **only if needed** (if classes end before 6 PM, no break).
- If I have **classes until 8 PM**, I want a **0.5-1 hour break at 6 PM or 7 PM**, but **only if possible** (if classes end before 7 PM, no break).
- My schedule should be as **congested as possible** outside of the above constraints.
- if days off can be had at expense of more time in other days, then that is acceptable.
- i can only pick one instructor and section for a course
- I want good instructors no matter what


### Formatting:

- Use **Markdown tables** (`|Course ID | Days and Times | Room | Instructor | Status |`).
- Course ID format: `<Course code>-<Section number>`  
  **Example:** `AEEL 1201-2`
- Use **HTML tags** inside `.md`:
  - `<br>` for **line breaks**
  - `<hr>` for **section splits**
  - Additional HTML **only for structure**, not design.
- Ensure that **Days and Times, Room, and Instructor are properly aligned**, even when multiple sections exist.
- give with days data merged for a course and give all courses in same table

### Handling Multiple Sections:

- **All sections** for a professor must be **explicitly displayed**.
- **Do not repeat days and times** for these sections if already provided separately.

For **open seats**, format as:  
`open/closed (?-?)`  
where `?` represents numbers from the data.

For **Rating**, leave cells empty (to be filled later).
