1. What does real power mean? How is it different from $Q,~P$ and $S$?

## three phase systems

1. In a Delta system: when we have different line voltages, which one should be used for each branch of the delta system?

    **Ans:** <br>
    Have a look at the circuit connections. From which wire to which wire are the 2 points of a branch connected? Look for a line voltage that matches such a configuration.

2. Can resonance occur without resistance?

3. Which is correct:

    $j5~\Omega$ or $5j~\Omega$
