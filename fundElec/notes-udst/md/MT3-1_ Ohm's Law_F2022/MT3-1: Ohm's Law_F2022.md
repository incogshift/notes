FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRICITY I

MT3: Ohm's Law, Electrical Power and Energy

# Learning Objectives

· Draw a schematic diagram of a simple electric circuit

· Distinguish between conventional current and electron flow

· State the relationship between current, voltage and resistance

· Write the formula for Ohm's Law

· Calculate values of E, I and R using Ohm's Law

# Voltage, Current, and Resistance

· Potential Difference or Voltage: electrical pressure or force that exists between two points (it pushes the current through the circuit).

· Current: the rate of movement of electric charge (electrons) within a conductor or how fast charge is moving.

· Resistance: the opposition to the flow of current through the circuit (it affects the speed of the current).

## Ohm's Law

German scientist that discovered in 1827 electrical resistance is equal to

$$\mathbb{R}=\frac{\mathbb{V}}{\mathbb{I}}$$

# Ohm's Law

Simple Electric Circuit

· In electric circuits, the effect we are trying to establish is the flow of charge, or current. · The potential difference, or voltage, between two points is the cause ("pressure"), and the opposition is the resistance encountered.

# Ohm's Law

Simple Electric Circuit

· No voltage in an electric circuit will result in no reaction in the system and no current in the electric circuit. · Current is a reaction to the applied voltage and not the factor that gets the system in motion.

Basic circuit.

# Ohm's Law

Formula:

$$\bullet I=\frac ER\quad\mathrm{or}\quad I=\frac VR$$

. Where:

. $I=$ Total circuit current in Amps (A)

. $R=$ Total resistance in circuit in Ohms (Ω) . $E=$ Applied Voltage in Volts (V)

# Ohm's Law

> The symbol $E$ is applied to all sources of voltage

> The symbol $V$ is applied to all voltage drops across components of the network.

For any resistor, in any network, the direction of current through a resistor will define the polarity of the voltage drop across the resistor.

Defining polarities.

# Ohm's Law

·Example 1:

· Determine the current resulting from the application of a 9 V battery across a network with a resistance of 2.2 $\Omega$

# Ohm's Law

· Example 2:

· In the circuit shown the battery has an EMF of 12 V and the lamp has a resistance of 24 $\Omega$ . What is the current flow?

# Ohm's Law

· Example 3:

· What is the resistance in the circuit that has an EMF of 50V and the current flow is 10 mA‘

: R=(50/0.01)=5000=5k ohms

: 10*10-3

# Ohm's Law

·Example 4:

· What is the voltage drop across the resistor in the circuit if the current flow is 5 mA and resistor is 2.2 k$\Omega?$

# Electron Current vs. Conventional Current

· The flow of electrons is termed electron current. Electrons flow from the negative terminal to the positive.

· Conventional current or simply current, flows from the positive terminal to the negative as if positive charge carriers cause current flow.

Conventional Current flow is the standard that most all of the world follows.

## Ohm's Law

·Example 5:

· Calculate the current through the 2.2 kQ resistor if its voltage drop is 16 V.

Vr1 = 16 V R1 + 12.2kQ

# Ohm's Law

· Example 6:

· Calculate the resistor value if its current is 4 mA and its voltage drop is 20 V.

$$\begin{aligned}\mathbf{V}_{\mathbb{R}_1}&=20\mathrm{~V}\\\mathbf{I}&=4\mathrm{~mA~}-\mathbf{R}1\end{aligned}.$$

# Ohm's Law

·Example 7:

· Calculate the total current and voltage drop in each resistor?

# Plotting Ohm's Law

· The Ohm's law states that V and I are directly proportional for any one value of R. · This relation between V and Iis linear if the resistance is contestant.

The voltage values $V$ are marked on the horizontal axis, The current values I are on the vertical axis.

The two scales need not to be the same.

· The is Volt-Ampere graph characteristics for 5-Q resistance

# Plotting Ohm's Law

· Once the V-I graph is developed, the current or voltage at any level can be found from the other quantity.

· The greater the resistance, the smaller the slope.

![](./images/ftRIq1iWNeNPyIg2wKg4EZyVlLgYnyef8.png)

· from the linear curve, the resistance can be determined by the equation:
