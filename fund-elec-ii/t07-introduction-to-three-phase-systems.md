## Three-Phase Generator:
- Has 3 coils each seperated by an angle of $120^\circ$
- Hence has 3 sine waves
- Made of magnet (mobile) and conductor (stationary)
- The 3 line wires are of colors: Red, Yellow, Blue

Voltage differences between wires:
- $415~V$ between line and line
- $240~V$ between line and neutral

$$
\begin{align*}
    e_{AN}=E_{AN} \sin \omega t \\
    e_{AN}=E_{AN} \sin \omega t \\
    e_{AN}=E_{AN} \sin \omega t \\
\end{align*}
$$

$AN$ stands for: from A (line) to the neutral

Line voltage $(V_{ph} \text{ or } V_\phi)$: $\Delta V$ b/w line-line

Phase voltage $(V_L)$: $\Delta V$ b/w line-neutral

Phase sequence change can change the direction of turns of a motor

## Y-Connected Generator with a Y-Connected Load

$E_L = V_\phi \sqrt{3}$

$I_L = I_\phi$

## Y-$\Delta$ System

$V_L = V_\phi$

$I_L = I_\phi \sqrt{3}$

$$
\begin{align*}
    P_\phi &= V_\phi I_\phi \cos \theta \\
    P_T &= 3 P_\phi \\
    P_T &= \sqrt 3 V_\phi I_\phi \cos \theta \\
    Q_\phi &= V_\phi I_\phi \sin \theta \\
\end{align*}
$$

## Three-Wattmeter Method

$P_{T_Y} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3$<>
