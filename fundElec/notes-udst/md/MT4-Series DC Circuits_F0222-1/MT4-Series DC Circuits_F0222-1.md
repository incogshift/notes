# Total Series Resistance

· The total resistance of a series configuration is the sum of the resistance levels.

$$R_T=R_1+R_2+R_3+\cdots+R_N$$

· The more resistors we add in series, the greater the total resistance is.

### Total Resistance Examples

$$\mathrm{R_T}=7.04\:\mathrm{k}\Omega $$

# Total resistance measurement

## The total resistance of any configuration can be measured by simply connecting an ohmmeter across the access terminals.

· Since there is no polarity associated with resistance, either lead can be connected to point a, with the other lead connected to point b.

# Series Circuits

· If we now take an 8.4 V dc supply and connect it in series with the series resistors, we have the series circuit.

Schematic representation for a dc series circuit

The direction of conventional current flow is such that it leaves the positive terminal of the voltage supply and returns to the negative terminal of the supply.

The current is the same at every point in a series circuit

The polarity of the voltage across a resistor is determined by the direction of the current through it..

# Series Circuits

· Once we have a complete circuit the level of current and the voltage across each resistor must be demined. Use Ohm's Law

$$\cdot I_S=\frac E{R_T}$$

. Where:

. $I_{S}=$ Source or total current in the series circuit

. $E=$ Applied source voltage . $R_{T}=$ Total resistance of the circuit

# Series Circuits

Exercise 2: Determine the unknown voltages for the circuit.

# Voltage Division in Series Circuits

· The voltage across series resistive elements will divide as the magnitude of the resistance levels.

· The ratio of the voltages across series resistors will be the same as the ratio of their resistance levels.

![](./images/fWLevFoC4tEt0YlfrpqsCOmFdIkgiT004.png)

# Voltage Division

· Voltage divider rule permits the determination of the voltage across a series resistor without first having to determine the current of the circuit.

![](./images/fKwZXpPUzCmNSdfytgyZ2LlQz7guV59lg.png)

The formula can be developed from the following formulas based on total resistance and ohms law:

$$V_{Rx}=I_{T}\times R_{x}$$

$$\begin{aligned}&\mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{R3}}=\quad(\mathbf{E}/\mathbf{R}_{\mathbf{T}})*\mathbf{R}_{\mathbf{3}}\\\\&\mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{R3}}=\quad(\mathbf{12}/\mathbf{4k})\quad*\mathbf{1k}=\quad\mathbf{3}\:\mathbf{volts}\end{aligned}$$

$$\cdot I_{T}=\frac{E}{R_{T}}$$

. Voltage Divider Rule $\rightarrow$
$$V_{Rx}=\frac E{R_T}\times R_x$$

![](./images/fGS6uy9GgIUMFBDXNsFrFDQmXDBup7mbQ.png)

# Voltage and Current Measurements

· The insertion of any meter in a circuit will affect the circuit.

. Voltages of a circuit can be measured without breaking the connections in the circuit.

· Start with a scale that will ensure that the reading is less than the maximum value of the scale. Then work your way down in scales until the reading with the highest level of precision is obtained.

![](./images/fiiH56gWhp7ZAgO8gfbGvZrAZxkNimPGE.png)

# Voltage and Current Measurements

· Using an ammeter to measure the current of a circuit requires that the circuit be broken at some point and the meter inserted in series with the branch in which the current is to be determined.

![](./images/fAgeQVztfikKtwxZuiBhPIB18M7KRzBT7.png)

# Power Distribution in Series Circuits

· The power applied by the dc supply must equal that dissipated by the resistive elements.
$$P_E=P_{R1}+P_{R2}+P_{R3}$$

 The power delivered by the supply,

$$P_E=EI_s$$

The power dissipated a resistive element,

$$P_R=V_RI_R=I_R^2R=\frac{V_R^2}R$$

# Solution:

 Applying the voltage divider rule:

$$V_{1}=20\:\mathrm{V}\bigg(\frac{470\:\Omega}{800\:\Omega}\bigg)=\:11.75\:\mathrm{V}\\V_{2}=20\:\mathrm{V}\bigg(\frac{330\:\Omega}{800\:\Omega}\bigg)=\:8.25\:\mathrm{V}$$

 The power dissipated by each resistor is:

The term “ground' typically means a common or reference point in the circuit.

![](./images/flNsxRK0dQfaAaqUaUGhN1rEAFiHi5Y2a.png)

Voltages that are given with respect to ground are shown with a single subscript. For example, $V_{\mathrm{A}}$ means the voltage at point A with respect to ground. $V_{\mathbf{B}}$ means the voltage at point B with respect to ground. $V_{\mathrm{AB}}$ means the voltage between points A and B.

Questinl: What are $V_{\mathrm{A}}$ VA $V_{\mathrm{A}},V_{\mathrm{B}}$ VB $V_{\mathrm{B}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{AB}}$ for the crout shown?
$$V_\mathrm{A}=12\mathrm{~V}\quad V_\mathrm{B}=8\mathrm{~V}\quad V_\mathrm{AB}=4\mathrm{~V}$$

# Double Subscripts

. If we wish to express the voltage between two points $a$ and $b$ we can express this as Vab. Point a is the point of interest and point b is the reference point. $Vab=Va-Vb$

![](./images/fRFGgwVBEqN8kmZap6M7ewpmgZr5CiWG1.png)

·If $a$ is at a higher potential than $b$ , then the voltage is positive; if $b$ is at a higher potential, the voltage is negative.

· To determine correct polarity, first calculate all voltage drops across all components. . Assign polarities. · As you go around a circuit, add the gains and subtract the drops.

# Double Subscripts

![](./images/fMVYmI8omPsY1nEXP9gHez4dbQHE3MKyx.png)

# Single Subscripts

In a circuit with a reference point, most voltages are expressed with respect to that reference point. The voltage at point a with respect to ground is Va. Any voltage with a single subscript is with respect to ground.

If the voltages at various points in a circuit are known with respect to ground, then the voltage between points is easily determined.
$$V_{ab}=V_a-V_b$$

## Example 11

Calculate $V_{\mathrm{ab}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{bc}}$ in the following circuit.

![](./images/fcQcNfKr4XFoNDngS1wSfbuQ0zLHBQlNp.png)

$$\mathrm{V_{ab}~=V_{R1}~=V_{a}-V_{b}=+5V-(+3V)=+2~V}\\\mathrm{V_{bc}~=V_{R2}~=V_{b}-V_{c}=+3V-(-8V)=+11~V}$$
