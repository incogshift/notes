# Why Do Atoms Bond?

Chemical bonds form because

- they lower the PE between the charged particles that compose atoms

A chemical bond forms when the PE of the bonded atoms is less than that of the separate atoms

To calculate this PE, you need to consider the following interactions: - Nucleus-to-nucleus repulsions - Electron-to-electron repulsions - Nucleus-to-electron attractions

## 10.2 Types of Bonds

### We can classify bonds based on the kinds of atoms that are bonded together

# lonic Bonds · When a metal atom loses

electrons it becomes a cation

· When a nonmetal atom gains electrons it becomes an anion

then attracted to each other, resulting in an ionic bond

. NaCl, MgF2, KBr, etc.

![](./images/f3EKW0lAPNdagDYI2iRlT0cL0zQDlogHg.png)

Metallic Bonds

 Bonding results from attraction of cation for the delocalied electrons · Exists in nonmetals

· Nonmetals have relatively high ionization energies, so it is difficult to remove electrons from them

Covalent Bonds · The oppositely charged ions are · When nonmetals bond together, it is better in terms of potential energy for the atoms to share valence electrons Shared electrons hold the atoms together by attracting nuclei of

both atoms

Which compound is most likely to contain ionic bonds?

a. CH4 b.N2O C.MgF2

## 10.3 Valence Electron and Bonding

Valence electrons are held most loosely Valence electrons are most important in bonding

Lewis model focuses on the behavior of the valence electrons

For main-group elements, group number onial lodsthendic al. tells you the number of valence electrons Transition elements all have two valence electrons. Why?

![](./images/flqAuHoXqRUGNhvlk1gzy9GsT9bssx21e.png)

# Lewis Structures of Atoms

 In a Lewis structure, we represent the valence electrons as dots surrounding the symbol

- Also known as electron dot structures

We use the symbol of the element to represent the nucleus and inner electrons

![](./images/fwtgavH7Gx5C3MQ6t34pvGI6lb74kkkot.png)

· We use dots around the symbol to represent valence electrons

- Do not pair electrons until all 4 sides has one electron each

## Lewis Structures of Atoms

Atoms bond because bonding results in a more stable electron configuration

- More stable = lower potential energy

Chemical bond forms by atoms either transferring or sharing electrons.

Usually, this results in all atoms obtaining an outer shell with eight electrons

- Octet rule

- There are some exceptions to this rule: The key to remember is to try to get an electron configuration like a noble gas

What is the Lewis symbol for silicon?

![](./images/fVz9muk3G9XliHYVVgWECdGx9m31HHL5o.png)

## 10.4 Lewis Theory and lonic Bonding

Metals form cations by losing valence shell electrons Nonmetals form anions by gaining valence electrons

Lewis symbols can be used to represent the transfer of electrons from a metal atomto a nonmetal atom

K· + :Cl: —→ K+[:C1:]- K1s22s-2p3s23p4s1 Kt 1s2s²2p°33°4s 0 Octet in previous level

# lonic Bonding Model versus Reality

lonic compounds do not exist as individual units, but rather as a crystal lattice

A crystal lattice is a 3D network of the alternating cations and anions

The crystal lattice is held together by the electrostatic attraction of the cations for all the surrounding anions

- Attractions between cations and anions are maximized, leading to the most stable arrangement

 The attractions between the opposite ions are strong

- The stronger the attraction (larger the lattice energy), the higher the melting point

- The force of attraction is proportional to the product of the charges - larger charge also means stronger attraction

![](./images/fmRoi3UzpUF3aD88Y2XDioiECcyDgo55q.png)

# lonic Bonding Model versus Reality

Lewis theory predicts ionic compounds should have high melting points and boiling points because breaking down the crystal should require a lot of energy

lonic compounds have high melting points and boiling points.

- Melting points generally > > $>300°C$

 - All ionic compounds are solids at room temperature

![](./images/flNRb8lXcBQnuHmhGlSNXTmPSfBBGbVl5.png)

Electrostatic attraction is nondirectional!

 - No direct anion-cation pair

 Therefore, there is no ionic molecule

- The chemical formula is an empirical formula, simply giving the ratio of ions based on charge balance

# Properties of lonic Compounds

Properties of ionic compounds are predictable by Lewis model

![](./images/fVqNzdDRQY6XbBezwlK0pDHVl21uLCFXf.png)

![](./images/fSxCEgPyYx8OZgBGs3xsUuY2rsno3pCpL.png)
NaCI(1)

Hard and brittle crystalline solids

- All are solids at room temperature

Melting points generally > 300°℃

The liquid state conducts electricity

- The solid state does not conduct electricity

Many are soluble in water

![](./images/fZMwH5YVxKhvCzfMT1ZgiDsLkWZByfW6R.png)

- The solution conducts electricity well

Use the ionic bonding model to determine which has the higher melting point: NaCl or MgO. Explain the relative ordering.

a. MgO has a higher melting point because the ions have larger charges.

b. MgO has a higher melting point because the ions have smaller charges.

c. NaCl has a higher melting point because the ions have larger charges. d. NaCl has a higher melting point because the ions have smaller charges.

# 10.5 Covalent Bonding: Lewis Structures

Lewis structures depict neighboring atoms as sharing some (or all) of their valence electrons in order to attain octets (or duets for H)

 The shared electrons would then count toward each atom's octet

· A shared pair of valence electrons is called covalent bond.

Electrons that are shared by atoms are called bonding pairs

Electrons that are not shared by atoms but belong to a particular atom are called lone pairs (also known as nonbonding pairs)

![](./images/fc4lhfb0xfXIWm0TbuvXG0RSKBdE7kRgZ.png)

# Single Covalent Bonds

When two atoms share one pair of electrons, it is called a single covalent bond (2 electrons involved)

 One atom may use more than one single bond to fulfill its octet · Only duet for H, not octet

![](./images/ftqvMcrlsIeArkev4Okfs7WGcb8pMneXu.png)

![](./images/fC85mg22ilQuuW2m7MZvU8iXSbFa1e837.png)

H:O: H

## Double Covalent Bond

When two atoms share two pairs of electrons the result is called a double covalent bond (4 electrons involved)

![](./images/f6LEKN9uO9Wsp0gRrwRIGVygoeX1eQcwr.png)

![](./images/fkqGTA5iNkrBPTEOgFYbLRnQNyWs95wlF.png)

· Octet is satisfied in all cases

# Triple Covalent Bond

When two atoms share three pairs of electrons the result is called a triple covalent bond (6 electrons involved)

$$:\mathbb{N}:::\mathbb{N}:or:\mathbb{N}\equiv\mathbb{N}:$$

· Octet is satisfied in all cases

# Covalent Bonding: Model versus Reality.

Lewis model implies that some combinations should be stable, whereas others should not

- Because the stable combinations result in “octets"

Using these ideas from Lewis theory allows us to predict the formulas of molecules of covalently bonded substances

Hydrogen and the halogens are all diatomic molecular elements, as predicted by Lewis theory (duet for H)

 Oxygen generally forms either two single bonds or a double bond in its molecular compounds, as predicted by Lewis theory.

- In some stable compounds oxygen may have one single bond and 20 another where it has a triple bond, but it still has an ctet

Oxygen is more stable when it is singly bonded to two other atoms

![](./images/fXMbGrFtvcmFdyNoewTrPh9bbAtvmBNcG.png)

## 10.6 Electronegativity

The ability of an atom to attract bonding electrons to itself is called electronegativity

Increases across period (left to right) and decreases Trends in Electronegativity down group (top to bottom)

- Fluorine is the most electronegative element - Francium is the least electronegative element - Noble gas atoms are not assigned values - Opposite of atomic size trend

![](./images/fdtgukKSXiyGNLyW2hkqZfMph6z0Z4GyM.png)

The larger the difference in electronegativity, the more polar the bond

# Electronegativity and Bond Polarity

Covalent bonding between unlike atoms results in unequal sharing of the electrons

![](./images/fS6dzkTkLzNCueA9sgSWGbgQSbtBwVBBI.png)

The result is a polar covalent bond

 -One atom pulls the electrons in the bond closer to its side - One end of the bond has larger electron density than the other - Bond polarity -The end with the larger electron density gets a partial negative charge -The end that is electron deficient gets a partial positive charge

23

# Electronegativity and Bond Polarity

Most bonds have some degree of sharing and some degree of ion formation

Bonds are classified as covalent if the amount of electron transfer is insufficient to display the classic properties of ionic compounds

If the electron sharing is unequal, the bond is classified as polar covalent
![](./images/fSGW2G7xg8IoH74RaRqFcvwWY82uBOBrh.png)

![](./images/fUhSoadTRBLFXUXbLcG7DUhByHM20sqz2.png)

Arrange these elements in order of decreasing electronegativity: P, Na, N, Al.

a. N > P > Al > Na b.P>Na>N>Al
$$\mathrm{c.~Na>Al>P>N}$$
d.Al > Na > N > P

# Electronegativity Difference and Bond Type

If the electronegativity difference between bonded atoms is 0.1 to 0.4, the bond is pure covalent

- Equal sharing, also nonpolar

If the electronegativity difference is 0.4 to 1.9, the bond is polar covalent

If the electronegativity difference is larger than or equal to 2.0, the bond is ionic

# Lattice Energy

- Lattice energies become less exothermic (less negative) with increasing ionic radius.
- Lattice energies become more exothermic (more negative) with increasing 
magnitude of ionic charge

# Bond Dipole Moments

Dipole moment, μ, is a measure of bond polarity

-A dipole is a material with a + and - end

- It is directly proportional to the size of the

partial charges and directly proportional to the distance between them.

$$\mu=(q)(r)$$

Here, SI units are usually used which gives the answer in $\text{C} \cdot \text{m}$ which should be converted $D$.

$$
\begin{align}
	1\ D &= 10^{-18} \text{statC}\cdot cm \\ \text{where, 1 statC} &= \frac{1}{c} \text{C} \\
\end{align}
$$

![](./images/fPnxmxn7yO12B1RspgMswz56ygNTVlUQ4.png)
· Not Coulomb's law · Measured in Debyes, D

Generally, the more electrons two atoms share and the larger the atoms are, the larger the dipole moment

# Percent lonic Character

$\% \text{ionic character} = \dfrac{\text{experimental dipole moment}}{\text{dipole moment if electron were completely transferred}} \times 100$

* experimental ionic character $\rightarrow$ is given by the question
* dipole moment if electron were completely transferred $\rightarrow$ is calculated by using $\mu=(q)(r)$, where $q$ is the charge of an electron and $r$ is the bond length between the concerned bond

The percent ionic character is the percentage of a bond's measured dipole moment compared to what it would be if the electrons were completely transferred

The percent ionic character indicates the degree to which the electron is transferred.

The HCl() molecule has a bond length of 127 pm and a dipole moment of 1.08 D. Without doing detailed calculations, identify the best estimate for its percent ionic character.

## Lewis Structures of Molecular 10.7 Compounds and Polyatomic lons

1. Write the correct skeletal structure for the molecule Hydrogen atoms are always terminal - The more electronegative atoms are placed in terminal positions.

2. Calculate the total number of electrons for the Lewis structure by summing the valence electrons of each atom in the molecule

3. Distribute the electrons among the atoms, giving octets (or duets in the case of hydrogen) to as many atoms as possible

4. If any atoms lack an octet, form double or triple bonds as necessary to give them octets

## Step-by-step guide to drawing Lewis structures for molecular compounds and polyatomic ions

1. Find the sum of valence electrons of all atoms in the polyatomic ion or molecule.

![](./images/fFMYgpLUULSZ8KokEUIUERKBgEHkcrQmT.png)

If it is an anion, add one electron for each negative charge.

If it is a cation. subtract electron for each one positive charge.

## Writing Electron Dot Formulae

![](./images/fn3OGs1co3WnEImk5UKIBmIOPZdTL467u.png)

Keep track of the electrons:

$$26-6=20$$

2. The central atom is the least electronegative element that Connect the isn't hydrogen. outer atoms to it by single bonds.

## Writing Electron Dot Formulae

4b. If you run out of electrons before the central atom has an form multiple/triple octet. bonds until it does.

![](./images/fgnrdX5ME0kFF09wgZmtwmagYGmoWkoGc.png)


# Resonance Structures

* Extensions of Lewis model suggest that there is some degree of delocalization of the electrons; we call this concept resonance

- Delocalisation means not staying in its place (approximate definition)

* Delocalization of charge helps to stabilize the molecule

* When there is more than one Lewis structure for a molecule that differ only in the position of the electrons, they are called resonance structures.

* The actual molecule is a combination of the resonance forms-a resonance hybrid. - The molecule does not resonate between the different forms, though we often draw it that way Look for multiple bonds or lone pairs

# Resonance Structures

* A resonance structure is one of two or more Lewis structures for a single molecule that cannot be represented accurately by Only one Lewis structure.

$$\mathrm{n:~5+(3\times6)+1=24~e^{-}}$$
$\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$

![](./images/f1STzcgQ0ixXDCOC6hWgrsXZrWPMaHFRL.png)

The nitrate ion structure is the average of all the three equivalent structures, not one of them. From experiments, the three NO bonds are found to be identical.

# Formal Charge

* Formal charge is a fictitious charge assigned to each atom in a Lewis structure that helps us to distinguish among competing Lewis structures

* In a Lewis structure, we calculate an atom's formal charge, which indicates the charge it would have if all bonding electrons were shared equally between the bonded atom

$$FC= # valence e- - [nonbonding e- + 1/2 bonding e-]$$

· Sum of all the formal charges in a molecule = 0. - In an ion, total equals the charge

# Formal Charges

In general, when we calculate formal charges, these four rules apply:

- The sum of all formal charges in a neutral molecule must be zero.
- The sum of all formal charges in an ion must equal the charge of the ion.
- Small (or zero) formal charges on individual atoms are better than large ones.
- When formal charge cannot be avoided, negative formal charge should reside on the most electronegative atom.
