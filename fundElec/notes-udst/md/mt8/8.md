If you are removing the current source, replace with an open circuit
If volatage source, replace with closed circuit

We can apply current divider rule or use ohms law

using ohm's law:
voltage through each wire exiting the node will be 9 V

So, $I_2=\dfrac{E}{R_1+R_2}$

In superposition
- If you take up as positive, final answer will be up regardless of direction
- If you get -ve up, that means the actual direction is down.
