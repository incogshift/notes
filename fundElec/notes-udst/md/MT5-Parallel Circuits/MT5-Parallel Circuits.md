# Parallel Circuits

Two elements, branches, or circuits are in parallel if they have two points in common.

$R_{3}$ is in parallel with the series

combination of $R_{I}$ and $R_2$

# Total Parallel Resistance

 The total resistance of parallel resistors is always less than the value of the smallest resistor.

· In a parallel circuit, the branch with the lowest

resistance always has the most current.

· In general, when the total resistance is desired, the following format is applied:

Note:-Parallel resistors can be interchanged without affecting the total resistance.
