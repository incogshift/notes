# Changes in internal energy

Example: Calculate the change in internal energy (<E) for a gas in the following two processes: A. The gas absorbs 20 J of heat and does 12 J of work as it expands. B. The gas releases 30 J of heat and has 52 J of work done on it as it contracts.

### Process A:e

 The gas absorbs 20 J of heat $(q=+20$ J) and does 12 J of work by expanding $(w=-12$ Jy

$$\Delta E_A=q+w=20\:\mathrm J+(-12\:\mathrm J)=8\:\mathrm J$$

### Process B:

The gas releases 30 J of heat $(q=-30$J ) and has 52 J of work done on it as it contracts ( $w=$ +52 J)

$$\Delta E_B=q+w=-30\text{J}+52\text{J}=22\text{J}$$
