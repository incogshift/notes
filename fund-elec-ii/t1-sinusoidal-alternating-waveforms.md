# Waveform

- The **waveform** of a signal is the shape of its graph as a function of time
- The term **alternating** indicates that the waveform alternates between two prescribed levels in a set time sequence
- The term **AC** means alternating current


## Attributes

Illustated using a voltage graph (Current graph is not the same but similar).

In a sinuisoidal voltage, $v = f(t) = V_m \sin (\omega t \pm \theta)$: 
- Cycle: One positive and one negative peaks together
- Instantaneous value
- Periodic waveform: repeats after the same interval
- Alternating voltage, $v$ or $e$
- Alternating current, $i$
- $V_p=V_m=$ Amplitude
- $I_p=I_m=$ Amplitude
- $V_{p-p}$
- $I_{p-p}$
- Time Period, $T$
    - Unit: $\mathrm{s}$
- Frequency, $f$
    - Units: 1 hertz $\text{(Hz)}$ = 1 cycle per second $\text{(cps)}$
- Angular velocity, $\omega = \dfrac{2\pi}{T} = \dfrac{\alpha}{t}$
    - $\alpha$ is the angle
    - Unit: $\mathrm{rad\cdot s^{-1}=rad/s}$
- $\theta$ is the phase difference between voltage and current with respect to one of them. To illustrate this: When $\theta$ is $30^\circ$ with current leading:
    - $\theta_V$ is $-30^\circ$ and $\theta_I$ is $0^\circ$
    
        or
    - $\theta_I$ is $30^\circ$ and $\theta_V$ is $0^\circ$

> The following is for clarity. Don't use it. Cuz this isn't usually used in UDST

> A formula with a more definition exact notation would be:
>    $$v = f(t) = V_m \sin (\omega t \pm \Delta\phi_{VI})$$
>    or
>    $$v = f(t) = V_m \sin (\omega t \pm \Delta\phi_{IV})$$

## Root-mean-square:

- $V_{rms} = \dfrac{V_m}{\sqrt{2}}$

- $I_{rms} = \dfrac{I_m}{\sqrt{2}}$

> - Usually in exam questions:
>    - $I=I_{rms}$
>    - $V=V_{rms}$

## Polar representation:

$v = V_m \sin (\omega t \pm \phi) = V \angle \pm \phi = V_{rms} \angle \pm \phi$

When $v = V\angle 60^\circ$ and $i = I \angle 30^\circ$:
- The voltage is leading the current by $30^\circ$

    or
 
- The current is lagging the voltage by $30^\circ$

## Average

From graph:

Area of a cycle (Addition of positive area and negative area) divided by the time period
