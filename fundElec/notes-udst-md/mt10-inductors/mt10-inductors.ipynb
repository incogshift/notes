    "**Tapped inductors** are inductors that have one or more additional electrical connections (called taps) made along the winding of the coil, instead of just at the two ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "These taps at specific points along its length have different voltage or impedance levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **variable (permeability-tuned) inductor** is an inductor whose inductance can be adjusted by changing the magnetic permeability of its core—typically by moving a ferromagnetic core (like iron or ferrite) into or out of the coil.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "- Inductance $L \\propto \\mu L \\propto \\mu$, where μμ is the permeability of the core material.\n",
    "- When a magnetic core is inserted deeper into the coil, the permeability increases, and so does the inductance.\n",
    "- When the core is pulled out, permeability decreases → inductance drops.\n",
