11. Driving in fog

Fog causes the reduction of visibility level, and driving
conditions become danger. If the driver could not
postpone his trip until settlement of fog, he has to follow
the following guidelines.

Reduce the speed, because as you drive at slower
speed you will have better time to stop and avoid danger.

Use low head lights or fog lights, where vision is hard
Ito the driver and other users of the road in heavy fog.

Fog intensity may vary from light cloud to heavy
cover, and when the driver enter into fog, he should look
at vehicle mirrors and use foot brake gently so that his
vehicle lights warn other drivers.

Make sure that high light is not lit by mistake, because
high lights make the light higher inside fog and make

ision hard

that some drivers are get used to drive in fog conditions
land gradually they increase their speed

If the driver cannot see the road in front of him for
Imore than 12 meter, he has to reduce his speed to less
that 40km/h.

Use windscreen wipers and humidity remover.

Be aware of other drivers who do not use their head
lights.

Reduce the adjust speed continuously.

Keep a sufficient distance between you and the

ehicle in front of you
