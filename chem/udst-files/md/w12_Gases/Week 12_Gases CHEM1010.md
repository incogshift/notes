# Basic properties of a gas

There are four basic properties of a gas:

Pressure $(P)$ Volume $(V)$ Temperature (T), and Amount in moles $(n)$

These properties are interrelated—when one changes, it affects the others.

The simple gas laws describe the relationships between pairs of these properties.

# Basic properties of a gas: V, n, T

Volume:

A gas expands uniformly to fill the container in which it is placed. So, The volume of the container is the volume of the gas Volume may be in liters, mL, or cm3 (1 ml = 1 cm?)

$$\mathrm{I~L=10^3~cm^3=10^{-3}~m^3}$$

Amount:

m n= Amount of a gas is the number of moles; MM

Temperature:

The temperature of a gas must be indicated on the Kelvin scale:

Tk = T。c + 273.15

## 6.2 Pressure: The Result of Molecular Collision

Pressure is the force exerted per unit area by gas molecules as they strike the surfaces around them.

Just as a ball exerts a force when it bounces against a wall, a gaseous atom or molecule exerts a force when it collides with a surface.

Gas pressure is a result of the constant movement of the gas molecules and their collisions with the surfaces around them.

# Atmospheric Pressure Effects

- Variation in pressure in Earth's atmosphere creates wind and pressure.

- The H on this map indicates a region of high pressure, usually associated with clear weather.

- The L indicates a region of low pressure, usually associated with unstable weather.

- The number of gas particles in a given volume decreases with increasing altitude

    - **Pressure decreases with increasing altitude**.

## Gas Pressure and Particle Density


- Pressure exerted by a gas is dependent on the number of gas particles in a given yolume

Pressure and Density

![](./images/fThefOZObtHZAbXZE9G7kI4myTfwEGrVg.png)

Higher pressure Lower pressure

- The fewer gas particles, the lower the force per unit area and the lower the pressure

    - A low density of gas particles results in low pressure

    - A high density of gas particles results in high pressure

# Kinetic Theory of Gases

- Gases have vibrational, rotational, and translational movement

    - Most of a gas is empty space

        - Gas particles are very tiny - Gas particles are always moving randomly

    - Gas particles are always moving randomly

![](./images/fNL5qRqCe7bNMZ1Ygb9pnrW3VftPv2orr.png)

- Particles act independently of each other

- Weakest intermolecular forces : Greatest volume between particles

## Simple Gas Laws

1. Boyles' Law 2. Charles's Law 3. Gay-Lussac's Law 4. Combined Gas Law 5. Avogadro's Law 6. Ideal Gas Law

# Boyle's Law (P vs V) (n, T constant)

Boyle's law states:

The volume of a fixed quantity of gas at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure.

![](./images/f9p4QgQuxZx2SA7EVVpupGr9cZvhVFBEe.png)

![](./images/fNPmqkZtyGVSaIFKRZY6zDwY1Q7uNymDw.png)

PV= k

### Boyle's Law:

## - P and V are inversely proportional

Since

$PV= k$

$V= k(1/P)$

![](./images/fcL3kUlu9rgNT0Y8MdfiP4NFkN5set23a.png)

This means a plot of V versus 1/P will be a straight line.

Boyle's law can be stated as $P_1V_1 = P_2V_2$, (T, n constant)

## Charles's Law (V vs T) (n, P const)

Charles's law states:

In a fixed amount of gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its Kelvin temperature.

$$\bullet\mathrm{~i.e.},\quad\frac VT=k$$

![](./images/ffxnSFCw4GGCIeEMMgtYFImageGXWbgZD.png)

## Charles's Law

For two conditions, Charles's law is written:

$\dfrac{V_1}{T_1}=\dfrac{V_2}{T_2}$, Assuming (n, P constant)

![](./images/fRhxK4sNtAWTSBgCPgxLAo5B8kS3rS4iP.png)

# Concept Check

The pressure exerted on a sample of a fixed amount of gas is doubled at constant temperature, and then the temperature of the gas in kelvins is doubled at constant pressure. What is the final volume of the gas?

a. The final volume is twice the initial volume.

b. The final volume of the gas is four times the initial volume.

c. The final volume of the gas is one-half the initial volume.

d. The final volume of the gas is one-fourth the initial volume.

e. The final volume of the gas is the same as the initial volume.

# Gay-Lussac's law (P vs T) (n, V constant)

Gay-Lussac's Law states:

The pressure of a fixed amount of gas at constant volume is directly proportional to its Kelvin temperature

$$\bullet\mathrm{~i.e.},\quad\frac PT=k$$

![](./images/fHrtt6w8PVhqiqMRHwO1p2Op4bzQ5P4Zc.png)

Gay-Lussac's law is written, for two conditions

![](./images/fUI2dAh8p4PLpIKcyN91xg3S9wPl3ZbQU.png)

Where: V and n are constant

# Gas Laws

IWe now know three gas laws:

Charless Law

Gay-Lussac's Law

Boyle's Law

$$\frac{\mathrm{P}_1}{\mathrm{T}_1}=\frac{\mathrm{P}_2}{\mathrm{T}_2}$$

#

P1V1 = P2V2

Is there any way we can combine these?

28

### COMBINED GAS LAW:

$$\frac{\mathrm{P_1V_1}}{\mathrm{T_1}}=\frac{\mathrm{P_2V_2}}{\mathrm{T_2}}$$

Remember: Temperature must be in Kelvin!


# Avogadro's Law (V vs n) (P, T const)

Avogadro's Law states:

The volume of a gas at constant temperature and pressure is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas.

Mathematically, this means $V = kn$

![](./images/flXGsWwSue1KQCWeyGv4ggGkZoS6GRwQH.png)

Avogadro's Law can be written for two conditions
$$\frac{V_1}{n_1}=\frac{V_2}{n_2}$$

Where P and T are constant

Which action causes the volume of a gas sample to increase?

a. Decreasing the pressure (at constant temperature and number of moles).

b. Decreasing the temperature (at constant pressure and number of moles).

c. Decreasing the number of moles of gas (at constant temperature and pressure).

d. None of the above.

32

### The Ideal-Gas Law (Equation)

So far, we've seen that V:

Voc 1/P (Boyle's law) V oc T (Charles's law) 1 V oc n (Avogadro's law)

Combining these, we get

nT Vα1

The relationship

VαT

Then becomes:
$$V=R\frac{nT}P$$

# Ideal-Gas Equation

![](./images/f88gMNCef0sh6lmoIPGQkERSXBuvNqG3s.png)

The constant of proportionality is known as $\underline{R}$ , the gas constant.

Often written: $PV=nRT$

### Gas Constant

### 6.5
Applications of The Ideal Gas Law - Molar Volume, Density, Molar Mass of a Gas

`STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure)

- 1 atm P
- 273.15 K

![](./images/fMdZeDI1qfs7yYOaHocfgAbZWBqIqyz8F.png)

At STP, the molar volume of a gas can be calculated as follows:

$$V_{m}=\frac{V}{n}=\frac{RT}{P}=\frac{0.0821\frac{L\cdot atm}{mol\cdot K}\times273.15\:K}{1.00\:atm}=22.4$$
L/mol

STANDARD AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE

- T = 298.15 K
- P = 1 atm
- $V_M$  (Molar Gas Volume)= 24.465 L

# Density of a Gas at STP

 Density is the ratio of mass to volume. - Density of a gas is generally given in gram/Liter. The mass of 1 mole = molar mass. The volume of 1 mole at $\mathsf{STP}=22.4$ L

 $\mathrm{Density = \frac{molar~mass}{molar~volume}}$

- Density is directly proportional to molar mass

![](./images/f9BgTxPzAniVHPcPieblE5gLSCwFt5gGD.png)

## 6.6 Mixtures of Gases and Partial Pressures

- Many gas samples are not pure but are mixtures of gases

- Dry air is a mixture containing nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and a few other trace gases

![](./images/fYpIkZfXhrAmZimGMUnYsYxOpsWrIQXhT.png)

- In certain applications, the mixture can be thought of as one gas

- Even though air is a mixture, we can measure the pressure, volume, and temperature of air as if it were a pure substance

- We can calculate the total moles of molecules in an air sample, knowing P, V, and T, even though they are different molecules

# Partial Pressure

- The pressure of a single gas in a mixture of gases is called its partial pressure

- We can calculate the partial pressure of a gas if:
  - we know what fraction of the mixture it composes and the total pressure, or
  - we know the number of moles of the gas in a container of known volume and temperature

- The sum of the partial pressures of all the gases in the mixture equals the total pressure:

- Gases behave independently.

$$\mathrm{P_{total}=P_a+P_b+P_c+...}$$

- The pressure due to any individual component in a gas mixture is its partial pressure $(P_n)$

- We can calculate partial pressure from the ideal gas law by assuming that each gas component acts independently

$$P_a=n_\mathrm{a}\frac{RT}V;P_\mathrm{b}=n_\mathrm{b}\frac{RT}V;P_\mathrm{c}=n_\mathrm{c}\frac{RT}V; \dots$$

$$P_\mathrm{n}=n_\mathrm{n}\frac{RT}V$$

# Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures

$$P_\text{Total }=\mathrm{P}_\text{He}+\mathrm{P}_\text{Ar}$$

$P_{He}= 2~atm$

$P_{Ar}= 4 atm$

$P_{total}=2+ 4 = 6~atm$

![](./images/f4RArmUhXmG9WB5LIM3asggdiGeuahw6U.png)

## Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures

The total pressure of a mixture of gases equals the sum of the pressures that each would exert if it were present alone.

In other words:

$$P_{\mathrm{total}}=P_1+P_2+P_3+ \dots$$

$$P_1=X_1P_{\mathrm{total}}$$

$P_1$ : Partial pressure, $X_1$ : mole fraction = n,/ntotal

## Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures

The partial pressure of a component in a gaseous mixture is its mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure

- For gases, the mole fraction of a component is equivalent to its percent by volume divided by 100%

- Nitrogen has a 78% composition of air; find its partial pressure

$$\begin{aligned}P_{N_{2}}&=0.78\times1.00\:\mathrm{atm}\\&=0.78\:\mathrm{atm}\\
P_{\mathrm{total}}&=P_{N_{2}}+P_{O_{2}}+P_{Ar}  \\
P_{\mathrm{total}}&=0.78\mathrm{~atm}+0.21\mathrm{~atm}+0.01  \\
&=\mathrm{ 1.00~atm}
\end{aligned}$$
atm


### Total Pressure

At STP, 1 mole of a pure gas in a volume of 22.4 L will exert the same pressure as 1 mole of a gas mixture in 22.4 L.

# Collecting Gases over Water

Gases are often collected by having them displace water from a container

The problem is that because water evaporates, water vapour is also in the collected gas

The partial pressure of the water vapor, called the vapor pressure, depends only on the temperature

- You can use a table to determine the partial pressure of the water vapor in the gas you collect.

- If you collect a gas sample with a total pressure of $758~mmHg$ at 25 °C, the partial pressure of the water vapor will be $23.48~mmHg$, so the partial pressure of the dry gas will be 734.52 mmHg. (See Table in slide 56.)

## Collecting Gases by water Displacement

Collecting a Gas over Water

A student collected a sample of hydrogen gas produced from the reaction of zinc with hydrochloric acid by the displacement of water at $25^{0}C$ .She collects 152 mL of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ at a total pressure of 758 mmHg. If the water vapor pressure is 23.48 mmHg at $25°C$ , calculate:

a. The partial pressure of hydrogen gas? b. The number of moles of the collected hydrogen gas?

$$(a)P_{total}=P_{H_2}+P_{H_2O}\:\to\:P_{H_2}=\:P_{total}-P_{H_2O}$$

$P_{H_2}=(758-23.48)mmHg=734._{52}mmHg$

H2
$$n=\frac{PV}{RT}=\:\frac{(734.24mmHg)(0.152L)}{(62.3636\frac{L\cdot mmHg}{mol\cdot K})(298.15K)}=0.00600_{22715}mo$$

b) What is the lowest temperature that causes the tank to explode?

$$
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}
$$

## 6.7 Gases in Chemical Reactions

- In reactions involving gaseous reactants or products, we often specify the quantity of a gas in terms of its volume at a given temperature and pressure

- The pressures on previous slide could also be partial pressures

- When gases are at STP, use 1 mole = 22.4 L

- The general conceptual plan for these kinds of calculations is as follows:
